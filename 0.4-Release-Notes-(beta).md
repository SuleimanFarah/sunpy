* removed pyfits dependency (as it will be phased into astropy).
* added astropy as a dependency for sunpy.
* GenericMap.norm is now an attribute holding a plt.Normalize instance rather than a function returning one.
* Most things have now been removed from the top-level namespace, meaning you now have sunpy.map.Map rather than sunpy.Map
* SunPy now optionally depends on Glymur which allows much improved JPEG2000 file reading without using external binaries. (Reading JPEG2000 is supported with the OpenJPEG shared libraries of version 1.5 +)
