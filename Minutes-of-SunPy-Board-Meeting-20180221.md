### Meeting Notes

**Topic 1:**

2 new releases: 0.8.4 & 0.8.3
     - 0.8.4 required for AstroPy compatibility
     - 0.8.3 does not currently work with AstroPy due to an issue with a bug fix

In progress: 0.9 & 1.0
     - 0.9 includes change from current library concerning VSO interaction & will include a revised JSOC client
     - 1.0 deletes Python 3 and uses AstroPy time object instead of date time object
          - http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/

New VSO/SunPy liaison

**Topic 2:**

GSOC progressing well
     - Currently 5 SunPy projects; open to more
          - http://openastronomy.org/gsoc/gsoc2018/#/projects
     - Looking for more mentors
          - https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor
          - https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/GSoC/blob/master/application_students.md

**Topic 3:**

SPD committee agenda item:
     - Jack will present request to SPD committee at upcoming TESS meeting

TESS presentations:
     - SunPy poster submitted to TESS meeting via Andrew Inglis and Jack
     - Python NDCubed poster submitted by Danny Ryan

**Topic 4:**

NumFOCUS survey
     - Questions about what support is needed from NumFOCUS (e.g., web hosting)
     - Discussion about possibly requesting support for FIDO upgrades

**Topic 5:**

IRISPy talks ongoing
     - merging of parallel IRIS and SunPy efforts led to development of splinter NDCubed effort led by Danny Ryan and Stuart
     - GUI QuickLook tool guidance being managed by Stuart 
     - NDCubed is a generic tool that will be merged into core package
     - IRISPy is not far enough along yet to be an affiliated package

**Topic 6:**

Affiliated package (AP) management discussion
     - discussion over instrument specific packages
          - core packages built to work on already calibrated with minimal processing
          - affiliated instrument packages handle data nuances
     - qualifications to be listed as an AP need to be delineated
          - tests/documentation/use of available functions
          - set of enforceable standards needed
          - using AstroPy experience as a foundation
               - official registry
               - tiers: provisional, accepted[, sponsored/branded]
               - light code review process
     - purpose of APs to not duplicate code, to get widespread use, and to work together for the positive evolution of the tools
          - build with core library
     - implementation more difficult than expected based on IRISPy experience (e.g. GitHub use, ownership issues)
     - voting process for accepting APs under review, possibly separate from the board
