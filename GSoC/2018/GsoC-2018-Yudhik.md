## **Project Proposal Information**

**Project**: ***Region of Interest***

**Mentors :** [dpshelio](https://github.com/dpshelio) ,[ wafels](https://github.com/wafels)



## **Abstract**

This project will need to redesign **roi.py** and **chaincode.py** to work well with coordinates used in the **ROI** and will cover not only images but other dimensions (**timeseries** or **multidimensional data**). This project aims to design and implement an object so that we can find **ROI in any physical dimension** ( such as spatial area or temporal range and interact with the rest of data types used in sunpy. 

The **TimeRange object** could be used to store the **time extent** of the "region". The region of interest object should also be derivable from the main object classes - **HEK, HELIO.**

So user uses HEK module to get a **list of events** of some time range and also those instances can then be **drawn as overlays on a Map instance**, like **`map.show(overlays=hekEvent)`**.

We will start it by using ROI on images and then timeseries and later spectra.

### **Project Goals :**

* Design the object to accommodate basic geometric shapes ( square, rectangle, circle, polygon, ..etc) as ROI.

* Interaction with other data types (overplot on maps, time ranges on timeseries,...)

* Extract information from the interaction (overlay a sunspot detection on a corona image and extract the information related to ROI .e.g total area of that region or the date at which it was observed).

* Extending ROI features to timeseries and later to spectra etc.

  ​

### **Deliverables:**

* Making a fully functional ROI object which will be capable of interacting with multiple data types of the sunpy and return a spatial area or temporal range for the queries.

* ROI module will be capable of returning particular area in the Sun at a particular moment in time, with the extent of area, contour, when it was observed etc.

* ROI will also be capable of returning list of events for a specified time range for a HEK query and for HELIO (hfc is not accessible from sunpy in an easy way so it depends on how the module is modified during these months, so the feature will be implemented as guided by the mentors).

* User will be able to overlay multiple ROI at the same time eg: `aia.show(overlay = [roi1, roi2, ...]`. 

* Make future addition of similar objects easier to integrate.



**Detailed Description:**

Currently, If users want to get information about Solar events such as flare information, active regions, they would have to first find HEK / HELIO results and after then specifies the timerange (which is the window he is interested in) and then club those two as an overlay. Finally, after that while reproducing images user will have to specify the bounding box to focus on a certain region.

  

Eg. If a user is interested in the finding the biggest coronal hole within 80 degrees north/south of the equator in "sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE"

```python
Class roi(object):
	def __init__ (self, object = None , timeseries =None, responses=None, *argv, **kwargs):
		if object is  'hek':
			self.hek_roi(responses, *argv, **kwargs)
	def hek_roi(self, responses = None, *argv, **kwargs):
		# for all responses building a return value based on different 
		# Arguments
		return roi_response

  	def helio_roi(self, responses = None, *argv, **kwargs):
		# for all responses building a return value based on different 
		# Arguments
		return roi_response
	def time_range(self):
		....
		return TimeRange(self.start_time, self.end_time)
  	def plot():
		...
	
```


**Parameters:**

- **Object** – type of object.
- **timeseries** – will contain sample data and source .
- **Response** - (ndarray) - array of responses.
- **Methods** : args that will define ROI attributes and properties.

**Returns:**

- **out**  – A final ROI response which can be overlayed on an image.

## CODE COMPARISON

### Initializing map and collecting responses from HEK



```python
imports ...
aia_map = sunpy.map.Map(sunpy.data.sample.AIA_171_IMAGE)
hek_client = hek.HEKClient()
start_time = aia_map.date - timedelta(hours=2)
end_time = aia_map.date + timedelta(hours=2)
responses = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),
                             hek.attrs.CH, hek.attrs.FRM.Name == 'SPoCA')
```


​    

```python
### Work which ROI will automate

area = 0.0
for i, response in enumerate(responses):
   if response['area_atdiskcenter'] > area and np.abs(response['hgc_y']) < 80.0:
       area = response['area_atdiskcenter']
       response_index = i
      
ch = responses[response_index]
p1 = ch["hpc_boundcc"][9:-2]
p2 = p1.split(',')
p3 = [v.split(" ") for v in p2]
ch_date = parse_time(ch['event_starttime'])
ch_boundary = SkyCoord(
   [(float(v[0]), float(v[1])) * u.arcsec for v in p3],
   obstime=ch_date,
   frame=frames.Helioprojective)
rotated_ch_boundary = solar_rotate_coordinate(ch_boundary, aia_map.date)
```



```python
### ROI

req_roi = roi(object = 'hek', responses, area_atdiskcenter_max = true ,hgc_y_max = 80 )
```





```python
### Plotting

fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.subplot(projection=aia_map)

aia_map.plot(axes=ax) #for current state
aia_map.plot(axes=ax, overlays = req_roi) #with ROI

ax.plot_coord(rotated_ch_boundary, color='c')
ax.set_title('{:s}\n{:s}'.format(aia_map.name, ch['frm_specificid']))
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```




**RESULT WITH MARKED ROI**

![RESULT WITH MARKED ROI](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DH5RLLP6ijn6RzvrSSHyqjoPtRYJ_mEC)

It will be more convenient to use ROI module as it will **save a lot of code** and time and will **automate certain lines of codes**. ROI will use various features to **enhance user experience** like aia.show(overlays=hek_events) will automatically mark our ROI with a certain **zoom** which is intended and will have space for **panning** as well. 

The final reproduced image will look like:

### Multiple ROI’s plotted

### Current implementation without ROI

```python
responses =[None]*4

### Roi-1: (biggest active region within 50 degrees east/west on the equator line)

responses[1] = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),hek.attrs.AR )

### Roi-2: (biggest active region within 50 degrees east/west on the equator line)

responses[2] = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),hek.attrs.CH )

### Roi-3 (biggest coronal hole within 80 degrees north/south fn the equator)

responses[3] = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),
                          	hek.attrs.CH, hek.attrs.FRM.Name == 'SPoCA')

response_index = [None]*4
rotated_ch_boundary = [None]*4
for j in range(1,4):
	area = 0.0
	for i, response in enumerate(responses[j]):
    		if j == 3 and response['area_atdiskcenter'] and response['area_atdiskcenter'] > area and np.abs(response['hgc_y']) < 80.0:
        		area = response['area_atdiskcenter']
        		response_index[j] = i
    		elif response['area_atdiskcenter'] and response['area_atdiskcenter'] > area and np.abs(response['hgc_x']) < 50.0:
        		area = response['area_atdiskcenter']
        		response_index[j] = i

ch = responses[j][response_index[j]]
p1 = ch["hpc_boundcc"][9:-2]
p2 = p1.split(',')
p3 = [v.split(" ") for v in p2]
ch_date = parse_time(ch['event_starttime'])
ch_boundary = SkyCoord(
	[(float(v[0]), float(v[1])) * u.arcsec for v in p3],
	obstime=ch_date,
	frame=frames.Helioprojective)
rotated_ch_boundary[j] = solar_rotate_coordinate(ch_boundary, aia_map.date)
```



### With ROI



```python
responses = [None]*4

### Roi-1: (biggest active region within 50 degrees east/west on the equator line)

responses[1] = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),hek.attrs.AR )

### Roi-2: (biggest active region within 50 degrees east/west on the equator line)

responses[2] = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),hek.attrs.CH )

### Roi-3 (biggest coronal hole within 80 degrees north/south fn the equator)

responses[3] = hek_client.search(hek.attrs.Time(start_time, end_time),
                          	hek.attrs.CH, hek.attrs.FRM.Name == 'SPoCA')

req_roi = [None]*4

	if i == 3:
		req_roi[i] = roi(object = 'hek', responses[i], area_atdiskcenter_max = true ,hgc_y_max = 80 )
	else:
		req_roi[i] = roi(object = 'hek', responses[i], area_atdiskcenter_max = true ,hgc_x_max = 50 )</td>
        
  ∀roi  rotated_ch_boundary[i] = solar_rotate_coordinate(ch_boundary[i], 

Aia_map . date )
ax = plt.subplot(projection=aia_map)

∀roi  ax.plot_coord(rotated_ch_boundary[i], color='c')
```

**Various Geometric Shapes which will help to plot ROI**

For geometric shapes like square and circle the arguments for ROI can be passed like:
	

​	

```python

Square[center_x, center_y, side_length]
Rectangle[center_x, center_y, breadth, height]
Circle[center_x, center_y, radius]
  
```

These geometric shapes can be used to represent ROI on a specific need and for the rest of the responses chaincode([convex](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConvexPolygon.html) and [concave](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConcavePolygon.html) polygon)



#### **Invalid user input**

As mentioned in the issue: [2498](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/2498) 

**Invalid inputs** by the user can be handled by first checking whether the given args belong to a dictionary of attributes of the object.



**Proposed solution:**

* Returning each wrong argument can be cumbersome so an error message can be returned describing the method and args which are expected and the specific order.
* Rest of the handling can be done in accordance with the proposed solution that we come up along with the mentors.



<u>Hence the following are the **main tasks** of the project</u> :

1. Make the object that could be used to define the region of interest (ROI).
2. ROI module will use various objects and data types as inputs (HEK/HELIO) to be used as overlays which could be plotted on the same image.
3. Extract information from the interaction (overlay a sunspot detection on a corona image and extract the total area of that region or the date at which it was observed).
4. Later the ROI can be extended to objects like timeseries and spectra.
5. Extending ROI features to timeseries and later to spectra etc.

### **Software packages to be used**

**Language:** Python

**Libraries and modules:** astropy, json, pytest, sympy

**SunPy dependencies:** numpy, scipy, matplotlib, suds, pandas





### **How I propose to complete the project:**

I have been contributing to SunPy from the beginning of the February. I will continue to discuss design specific problems and implementation details with my mentors before starting a new topic. Also, if I feel any problem needs to addressed or designed carefully I would rather go through several documentations and try finding solutions online and won’t hesitate approaching mentors for my doubts.

I spent a lot of time going through SunPy documentations and also through several references provided to me other than that. I also worked on some pseudo codes and getting to understand its functionalities and figured out the way to design a solution.

* I will push to my pull requests regularly to keep my mentors updated on my work.
* I will be updating the documentation parallelly with functionalities and methods I implement.
* I will update my blogs regularly.
* I will be available all the time for reviews and answer questions regarding my implementation.



## **GSoC**

### **Have you participated previously in GSoC? When? With which project?**

**No.** This is the **first time** that I would be participating in GSoC



### **Are you also applying to other projects?**

**No.** **SunPy** is the only organization that I am applying for.



### **Commitments**

I commit to work for 35-40 hours a week during GSoC period. I don't have any other internship or work during this summer.

I have my end Semester exams from 19 April – 27 April so I won’t be able to devote most of the time to the project. During that week I would be able to give 15-20 hrs and would further try whenever necessary.

My next semester will start from the 1st week of August still I would be able to devote most of my time as in the initial days of the semester we have less workload.



### **Eligibility**

Yes, I am eligible to receive payments from Google. For any queries, clarifications or further explanation of any approach/feature feel free to contact me at yudhik100@gmail.com and I shall be happy to reply.
