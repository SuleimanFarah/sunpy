Skills
==========
I've experience with many programming languages ​​(Python, Java, C#, C, Javascript, etc) In addition to other more scientific like R or Matlab.
About Python, I've knowledge about its numeric calculation libraries like (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, etc) and about Qt.
Other areas in which I've experience is web development, databases and software for robots.


Proposal
========
I want to try develop "Sunkit-image", especially:
1. Port the Multi-Scale Gaussian Normalisation code from [#1899](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1899).
2. Convert the [differential rotation code](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/master/sunpy/physics/differential_rotation.py) in SunPy to use [`sunpy.coordinates`](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/tree/master/sunpy/map).
3. Implement image warping for solar differential rotation. [#1876](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1876).
4. Implement the [OCCULT-2 algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5046) for coronal loop tracing.
5. Implement running and base difference functionality and the persistence transform. See Figure 2 in [this paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/102/pdf) for some ideas.
