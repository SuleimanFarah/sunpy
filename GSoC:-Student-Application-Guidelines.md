**WIP** **INCOMPLETE**

Proposal Guidelines
We expect to receive, as we did last year, lots of high quality applications. So please do give your application some thought!

Follow Google’s outline exactly: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal
The “deliverables” section is most important!
A clear understanding of the problem we need solved.
A clear plan of action. What are you going to actually do?
Milestones should be achievable and realistic.
Things happen! We can’t foresee every problem! We are happy to see proposals that say “I will do A and B. If there is time, I will do C.”
Read about our grading criteria for proposals.
We are happy to read your proposal and give you feedback. Please allow for a few days for us to get back to you – don’t wait until the last minute!



Student proposal grading criteria
Criteria
Once proposals have been finalised, student proposals will be graded based on the following criteria:

Understanding
Does the proposal accurately address the project area?
Nice bonus features in addition to the main project = good, ONLY unrelated ‘bonus’ features = bad.
Clear evidence of communication skills
Plan
Does the proposal have a realistic timeline?
Bonus for “what if things go wrong planning”, e.g. bonus features towards the end of the plan that can be removed if/when the bugs strike.
Resourcefulness
Can the student carry out tasks on their own over a three month period?
Lower points for gross overcommunication (“what should I name this variable?”), better if they quietly and competently get the job done but interact at appropriate times, e.g. InterMine bugs, sensible progress reports.
Is the student capable of following existing guidelines and instructions where appropriate?
Experience
Does the student have reasonable evidence they’ve competently done something relevant to this before? e.g. one or more of
a GitHub profile,
pull requests on InterMine’s repos
published applications
code from a uni assignment?
Note: we don’t require a PR to an intermine project. It’s handy as a source of evidence, but any of the others should do just fine.
Absolutely no work available - not even a published app, some work experience, or code from a class assignment, is a red flag.
How the ranking process works
All students with a finalised proposal will have their proposals reviewed by one or more mentors in the organisation, and ranked out of 10 based on the criteria above. This score will also be averaged to provide a mean result. These scores are not the final acceptance criteria - so a 9.1 won’t automatically win over an 8.6 - but they do help provide general guidelines for the mentors who are choosing from a large body of qualified students.

Accepted students
Students will be notified of their acceptance by Google when all accepted students are announced, and will not be notified of their internal grades. Please note that we usually have more highly qualified applicants than slots available for the organisation, so sometimes proposals that are genuinely very good have to be rejected. We genuinely wish we could take you all!

Here are some criteria that we consider when reviewing applications. We suggest that you think about these when writing your application.

Has the student interacted with the Mixxx community before submitting their application?
Does the student understand the purpose of their project? Do they understand what impact their project will have on users?
Has the student demonstrated that they have the ability to work with Mixxx's code? The best way to do this is by submitting pull requests and getting them merged. It can also be okay if a student works on a bug but is unable to solve it before the application deadline if they demonstrate competence working with the Mixxx code. Students must have submitted a pull request to Mixxx or provide links to code they have written before in their application (ideally both).
Has the student demonstrated that they can work independently and solve problems on their own without asking for help every step of the way?
Does the student understand the design and technical details of what will be required to implement their proposal?
Is the proposed timeline realistic considering any other obligations the student may have during GSOC?

GSoC Application Template
=========================

Be sure to read through all the advice on the wiki and the links we suggested first!

Writing your proposal
---------------------

To be considered, a GSoC application must have a written proposal submitted to
https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com.

If you want, you can start a wiki page to work on your proposal at
https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/.  If you add your proposal there, we will
help you edit it and provide feedback (though understand that we will not help
you write it).  You can add your application to our list of
[[GSoC 2018 Current Applications]].  To maintain a consistent naming
scheme, title your application: "GSoC 2018 Application <Your Name>: <Project
Name>".  Old applications can be found either through the links on the main
page of the wiki or by browsing through [[_pages]].

Note that your final application must be submitted at
https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com, so do not worry about the formatting of your
application on the wiki, as you will have to reformat it there.  You should
not be too concerned with the formatting on Google's website either, as we understand
that the text editor there is not the best for making things look nice
formatting-wise.  We are more concerned with the content of your application,
and that it is readable.

You may be able to get equivalent formatting in the GSoC portal from the wiki by
copying the webpage contents or messing with the HTML source, but you
shouldn't worry about it too much.

You should include the following information in your proposal:

Title
-----

Please use a succinct title that describes your proposal. **Do not include the words "GSoC", "2018", or your name in the proposal title.**

You the person
--------------

**Please put this information at the top of your proposal.**

* Your full name

* University / current enrollment

* Short bio / overview of your background

* How can we contact you (email, GitHub username, etc.)?  This information
  will help us associate all of your various usernames with you.

  - Email
  - GitHub username
  - Any other user name you want us to know about

Also, please use your full real name in your GSoC portal profile, so that it
appears in the proposal list.

You the programmer
------------------

In your project proposal let us know about your programming experience.  Don't
worry if you don't know SymPy or git.  Many of our students start fresh.
We will teach you what you need to know.

* What platform do you use to code?  What editor do you prefer and why?

* What is your experience programming?  Tell us about something you have
  created.

* What is your experience with Python?  What are your favorite features of
  Python that are lacking in most other common programming languages?  What,
  in your opinion, is the most advanced Python language feature or standard
  library functionality that you have used?

* What is your favorite feature of SymPy?  Demonstrate it here with a cool example.

* Have you ever used git or another version control system?


You and your project
--------------------

Answer the following questions in your proposal:

* What do you want to achieve?

* What excites you about this project?  Why did you choose it?

* What qualifications do you have to implement your idea?  For example, if you
  are implementing solvers for partial differential equations, what courses
  have you taken or books have you read on PDEs?  Why are you suited to work on
  this project?

* What have other people done on this idea?  Has it been implemented before?
  (hint: it probably has)  Are there any papers or blog posts about it?

* How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during, and after
  the Summer of Code? (we expect full time 40h/week during GSoC, but better
  make this explicit) If you plan to take any vacations over the summer, let
  us know about it here.

* Please provide a schedule of how this time will be spent on sub-tasks
  of the project over the period of the summer. While this is only
  preliminary, we will use it to help monitor your progress throughout
  the program.  Also understand that during the project you will issue
  weekly progress reports against that plan on your blog.

* In planning your project, it is good to note where along the way you could
  formulate a pull request. These would be points where you can have a self
  contained and well documented and tested piece of functionality. Doing this
  at several points during the summer helps to keep branch merges reasonable
  and code reviews manageable. A big code dump at the end of the summer will
  likely be hard to review and merge before the project deadline.

* Please do not verbatim copy text from the ideas page, or from other people's
  discussions about your project, but rewrite it in your own words.  If you
  include any significant text or code from another source in your
  application, it must be accompanied with a proper citation.  All papers or
  references that you use or plan to use must also be cited.  Put all this in
  a "References" section at the bottom of your application.

You do not need to format your application as a question/answer format
for the above questions, but we expect to see all of the above questions
answered in your application somewhere.

Patch requirement
-----------------

In addition to the written proposal, we require every GSoC applicant to write a
patch and get it pushed into our current master.

Please note that we take your patches to SymPy into strong consideration when
reviewing your proposal. This is your best opportunity to prove to us that you
are capable of doing what is in your proposal.

To do this:

* Set up your platform to develop with SymPy (install git, clone
  https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git, execute tests). The page on our
  [[Development workflow]] will walk you through setting up git and lays out
  our preferred way of development.

* Create an account at GitHub and fork SymPy (https://github.com/sympy/sympy).

* Find something in SymPy that doesn't work or needs improvement and send us a
  git patch fixing it. If you need inspiration, feel free to fix any issue
  from our `easy to fix issues list
  <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/list?q=label:EasyToFix>`_. Aside from
  the issues, search for ``FIXME`` or ``TODO`` in the code. You can grep from
  the command line with ``git grep "TODO"`` . You could also search for
  NotImplementedErrors and XFAILs).  You could also play with SymPy and find
  something that needs fixing or that could be implemented, and do it.

* Your patch must be code-related, not documentation. If your project will use
  a language other than Python (e.g., JavaScript), you should submit patches
  that use that language as well, so that we know that you know you are
  proficient in that language. **However, for the patch requirement to be
  fulfilled, you must have at least one patch in SymPy itself.**

* Report success on the SymPy list

* Publish your patch for peer review by creating a pull request on GitHub.
  You must submit a patch that is successfully reviewed and pushed in to be
  accepted. We do not consider applications without patches. This shows us that
  you know Python and that you are able to interact with the community.
  Furthermore, your patch must go through a GitHub pull request (as opposed to
  a patch file on an issue, for example), as this is not only the easiest way
  for us to review your code, but is also what we expect from a student working
  on a GSoC project.

* **In your application, please provide a brief summary of your contributions to
  SymPy so far, including unmerged work. At least one link to a merged pull
  request proving that you satisfied the patch requirement.**

* Note that because we may be slow to review the pull requests, you do not
  have to have your request merged by the application deadline (though you
  should try to do it if you can!).  But you do need to at least have one
  submitted by then.  We will give priority to reviewing requests that are
  needed to satisfy patch requirements.  It is up to you to respond to our
  feedback in a timely enough manner so that your patch gets merged before the
  acceptance deadline.

>This page is a combination of several other pages from around the world.
>We want to thank all those FOSS packages that we took heavy inspiration from.
>SymPy being the main one.
