## What is it?

> [ESA Summer of Code in Space](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis/) is a program run by the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/ESA).
>It aims at offering student developers stipends to write code for various space-related open source software projects.
>Through SOCIS, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios.
>In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.

SunPy has participated in the last seven editions (2011 - 2017).
During these editions SunPy has obtained a big push in the development and gained new members that have stuck to the core of SunPy.
Don't doubt to find a project you would like to do and apply for it (some time soon!).

## Requirements for Students

For those who want to apply, you need to follow the [[Google-Summer-of-Code]] rules, so please read over these pages and pay particular attention to [[GSoC: Advice for Students]].
In summary, this means communicating with the SunPy community and project mentors, with a (ideally recent) pull request made to the SunPy organisation.

**There is an extra requirement.**
The application on the SOCIC website is quite small and as such we require a formal application to be added to our wiki to be even **considered** for a SOCIS position.
