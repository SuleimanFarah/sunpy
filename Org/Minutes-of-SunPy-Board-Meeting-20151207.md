    - **Russell** is happy to stay on. Hopeful he will have more time to contribute in the future. But doesn't want to be an impediment to progress.
    - **Andy** also happy to stay on.
    - **Stuart** also is ok to renew board membership.
    - **Tom suggests that he step down**, having been on the board for 2 years. He suggests we could find an alternative AstroPy developer to take his place.
      - agreement that having someone from AstroPy on the Board is important.
      - **Tom** will stay on until a replacement is found. Board members will reach out to the AstroPy community to source a replacement

  - the board **authorises an offline vote** about renewing membership for the above Board members for a 2-year term.

**David Perez-Suarez** joined the meeting

  - discussion of **Numfocus** (nonprofit status)
    - Numfocus is a nonprofit organization
    - SunPy could join this - means can accept money (donations, grants)
    - could also set up a non-profit on our own. Probably would use an attorney for this. Might be expensive. This would avoid Numfocus overhead, but not clear which is the better approach.
    - need pluses and minuses of Numfocus. Not clear at the moment.
    - Numfocus overhead e.g. if AstroPy recieved $10,000, 7% goes to Numfocus + some base charge. Total approximately 10%. Rate goes down as the amount donated increases. For $1M, it would be around 5%. Might be room to negotiate amounts.
    - Numfocus seems easier overall.
    - Copyright issues
    - **Stuart** offers to open a dialogue with Numfocus.


  - **Funding opportunities update**
    - no funds available at NASA Goddard
    - pursuing possible funding from NASA HQ
    - host another SunPy workshop at SPD
    - prepare open letter asking for funding?!

**Meeting adjourns**
