##Project Proposal: SunPy - Database of Local Data  
###Abstract
When using the Sunpy library, the VSO toolkit allows users to download solar data to their local systems. One of the problems with this data, is that after it is downloaded and used, it is stored in such a way that it is not super conducive for future re-use. The proposed idea is to add the functionality of a SQLite database to the sunpy library. This local database would interact with the VSO toolkit during downloads to keep track of the data and its corresponding metadata in a functional local database, thus enabling future querying and re-use. 
###Deliverables

*	Create framework for a local SQLite database that interfaces with VSO  
   *	Stores file path  
   *	Stores attached metadata such as instrument, wavelength, source, etc.  
*	Create a namespace for querying the local database for specific sets of data  
*	When using VSO to gather new data, query the local database to prevent redundant downloads of data  
*	Provide documentation and testing

###Vacation Days
It's very probably that over the summer I will go on some weekend trips such as camping or driving up north to visit my family. This would mostly be over weekends but might require some weekdays for travel. It would be a good guess to say that I will probably need a total of a weeks worth of time, but that would be spread out over the whole summer. I'd be working on weekly objectives and I believe that with a few hours on weekends I could easily account for any missed days.
