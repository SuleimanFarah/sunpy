**WIP** **INCOMPLETE** **NOT FOR 2018**

Ideally an application should be concise and with that in mind, we would suggest not exceeding 10 pages in a Google Docs format. 
Any code you want to include could be in a gist but we recommend not writing empty pseudo code or just documentation strings. 
Also, we suggest you write the application in markdown first and then convert it to the Google Docs format after. 

You should include the following information in your application:

## Title

Please use a succinct title that describes your proposal.
**Do not include the words "GSoC", "\<Year\>", or your name in the proposal title.**

## You the person

**Please put this information at the top of your proposal.**

* Your full name

* University / current enrollment

* Short bio / overview of your background

* How can we contact you (email, GitHub username, etc.)?

    This information will help us associate all of your various usernames with you.
    - Email
    - GitHub username
    - Any other user name you want us to know about

Also, please use your full real name in your GSoC portal profile, so that it appears in the proposal list.

## You the programmer

In your project proposal let us know about your programming experience.  Don't worry if you don't know SunPy or version control.
Many of our students start fresh and we will teach you what you need to know.

* What platform do you use to code?

* What is your experience with programming?

* What is your experience with Python?

* What is your experience with Open Source?

* Have you ever used git or another version control system?

* What are your contributions to SunPy so far?

    It should be a brief summary (with links) of pull requests including unmerged work.

## You and your project

Answer the following questions in your proposal:

* What do you want to achieve? What excites you about this project? Why did you choose it?

* Why are you suited to work on this project?

* What have other people done on this idea? Has it been implemented before?

    Hint: it probably has.
    Are there any papers or blog posts about it?
    What about open issues or non-merged (open or closed) pull requests?

* If it involves any API changes, how does it affect the user?

    Does it improve on the current API? If so, how? 

* How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during, and after the Summer of Code?

    We expect full time \~35h/week during GSoC, but better make this explicit
    If you plan to take any vacations over the summer, let us know about it here.

* Will you require any software packages that are not already a requirement of SunPy? 

    If the answer is no, you can skip this.
    Please do not add redundant information into the application.

    If the answer is yes, what ones and why?
    We need to be given a good reason to add extra requirements to SunPy? 

* Please provide a schedule of how this time will be spent on sub-tasks of the project over the period of the summer.

    While this is only preliminary, we will use it to help monitor your progress throughout the program.
    Also understand that during the project you will issue weekly progress reports against that plan on your blog.
    Try to avoid using a table, it can cause issues when/if you move between Google Docs and the wiki (if you use markdown).

* In planning your project, it is good to note where along the way you could formulate a pull request.

    These would be points where you can have a self contained and well documented and tested piece of functionality.
    Doing this at several points during the summer helps to keep branch merges reasonable and code reviews manageable.
    A big code dump at the end of the summer will likely be hard to review and merge before the project deadline.

* Please do not verbatim copy text from the ideas page, or from other people's discussions about your project, but rewrite it in your own words.

    If you include any significant text or code from another source in your application, it must be accompanied with a proper citation.
    All papers or references that you use or plan to use must also be cited.
    Put all this in a "References" section at the bottom of your application.

You do not need to format your application as a question/answer format for the above questions, but we expect to see all of the above questions answered in your application somewhere.
