# Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

## What is it?

> Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development.
> GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

We participate in [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) via the [OpenAstronomy umbrella organization](https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/).

**For anyone who wants to apply to GSoC, you should read these wiki pages and the linked advice.**
**It will considerably help you to understand what is required to be successful for GSoC.**

## Guidelines and helpful advice

### SunPy focused

We have several pages for GSoC with [[GSoC: Advice for Students]] being the main one.

We have a [[GSoC Application template | GSoC: Student Application Template]], it should form the basis for your application.

[[GSoC: Mentors and Accepted Students]] is for mentors and accepted students.

> These pages are a combination of several other pages from around the world.
> We want to thank all those FOSS packages that we took heavy inspiration from, SymPy being the main one.
