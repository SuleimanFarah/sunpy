The release schedule for SunPy is detailed in [SEP-9](https://zenodo.org/record/3261800) - this wiki page contains concrete dates for past and future releases and feature freeze dates.

Releases are scheduled for the first Friday in the month set by SEP-9, and feature freezes are two weeks prior to the release date. All PRs which want to be included in a release must be opened (and ready for review) by the feature freeze deadline. In most cases, PRs which haven't been merged within a week of the release will be bumped to the following release.
