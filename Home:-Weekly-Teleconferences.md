### Minutes

**Present:** Jack, Albert, Shane, Nabil, Stuart, Will, David S.

* Follow up from coordination meeting
    * How often do we want these to happen?
    * Nabil suggested having more frequent, shorter, and focused meetings, e.g. around 3.0 -- weekly?
    * Should we tie times of meetings to the release schedule? (this happened, somewhat by coincidence, this time around)
    * At the very least, annual coordination meetings
* Issue triage
    * Boring, but needs to be done (mostly a TODO for Will)
    * Be more aggressive about closing issues, they can always be reopened
* `instr` issues need to be moved over to the `sunkit-instruments` repo
* PRs
    * HTML `__repr__` PR [#3951](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3951)
        * *nearly done
        * other features should go into other PRs
        * would be good to generalize to NDCube, but a lot of work
    * Deprecated decorator PR [#3982](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3982)
        * Merge soon
        * Create issue/PR upstream to astropy
        * break version calculation out into its own function
    * `cmap` and `norm` property PR [#3624](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/3624)
        * We underestimated how integrated `plot_settings` is in `Map`
        * Replace with a `plot_settings` subclass of `dict` that pulls out the plot-specific parts of the API
        * Deprecate `__getitem__` on this new object and then provide `cmap`, `norm`, etc. as properties on this object
        * Squash existing commits to preserve the contribution, close this PR,  and open a new PR on top of this branch (TODO for Nabil)
* Coworking hours
    * 9:00 UTC and 17:00 UTC
    * Tuesday (but reassess to see if this works for everyone)
