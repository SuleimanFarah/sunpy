# Google Summer of Code
## What is it?
> Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects.
> We have worked with the open source community to identify and fund exciting projects for the upcoming summer.

We participate with [GSoC](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) via the [OpenAstronomy umbrella organization.](http://openastronomy.org/gsoc/)
SunPy participated in 2013 for the first time and 2014 and 2015 under the [Python Software Foundation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/).
