This explains the various labels that we use in the issue tracker.

## unconfirmed-bug (Bug?)
No dev has acknowledged it.
## confirmed-bug
A core dev has acknowledged it with a comment.
## needs-docs
It's a known behavior that can be addressed through docs. Err on the side of this rather than "feature" whenever possible.
## feature-request
This is a new feature which is not currently included in SunPy.
## wont-fix
An issue that we've decided not to fix. This is a last resort: see if "needs-docs" works before using this label.
