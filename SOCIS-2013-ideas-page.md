The ideas shown below are projects that we believe can be completed during the SOCIS programming period (1 Aug - 31 Oct 2012).  The projects are sorted in order of interest to the SunPy community.  Please join the #sunpy IRC channel ([web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/)) to talk with the SunPy community.

## Spectrum Object
* **Description**: The SunPy project is built upon a number of objects which hold data such as the map object (for two-dimensional image data) and the lightcurve object (for time-ordered scalar data).  The third major object we require is the spectrum object, which is for data ordered by energy (or its equivalent, such as wavelength). The goal of this project is to design and implement the spectrum object for SunPy. This object will need to be able to display its data in a basic plot form. In addition, different sub-classes of the main spectrum object will also need to handle the various kinds of spectral data.  It will also need to be able to convert from data (e.g. counts) to physical quantities (e.g. photons) through knowledge of the detector response (for example, the detector response is typically described using a matrix). A number of physical models are also necessary to interpret spectra. Coding up efficient forms of these models can also be part of this project if time allows.
* **Requirements**: Basic knowledge of spectral data analysis a plus.
* **Mentor**: Richard Schwartz (?), David Pérez-Suárez (?)
