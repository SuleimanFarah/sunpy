## Porting of Critical software from SolarSoft

_Description_: SolarSoft is a software suite developed for IDL which already contains critical routines which are necessary for any basic analysis of solar data. Many of these routines must be ported to Python. This project aims to develop the basic framework of SunPy (coordinate transformations and projections, time manipulation, ephemeris calculations, etc.) which is currently based on IDL.<br/>
_Requirements_: Knowledge of IDL is necessary.<br/>
_Mentor_: Jack Ireland<br/>

## JPEG 2000 in Python

_Description_: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000 JPEG 2000] is an image compression standard which has been developed to supersede the JPEG standard. It is currently being used by the [http://wiki.helioviewer.org/wiki/Main_Page Helioviewer project] to provide high-fidelity images of solar data for purposes of browsing data quickly and with limited bandwidth. The first goal of this project is to write a wrapper around the [http://www.openjpeg.org/ OpenJPEG C library] in order to be able to open JPEG 2000 files from Python. Next, network code must be developed to hook into the [http://helioviewer.org/api Helioviewer API] to request and download data from their archives.<br/>

_Requirements_: Knowledge of C is necessary.<br/>
_Mentor_: Keith Hughitt<br/>

##  The Virtual Solar Observatory & Heliophysics Integrated Observatory 

_Description_: The ''[http://www.virtualsolar.org/ Virtual Solar observatory]'' (VSO) is a web service which provides a centralized location to search for solar data of most any type. The VSO has an [http://www.virtualsolar.org/API API] which provides the capability to build your own interface to the VSO. The goal of this project is to develop a Python interface to the VSO. The ''[http://helio-vo.eu/ Heliophysics Integrated Observatory]'' (HELIO) on the other hand is a similar project, but it also provides access to catalogs and event information, allows sciencists to run remotely high-demanding algorithms (e.g. propagation models of blobs of plasma ejected from the sun through the solar system).  The second goal of this project would be to develop the Python client to connect to the different services offered by HELIO.<br/>
_Requirements_: Knowledge of Python required; knowledge of web services (SOAP, REST) preferred.<br/>
_Mentor_: Joe Hourclé and David Pérez-Suárez<br/>

##  STIX Simulations 
_Description_: STIX is an instrument on [http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=45 Solar Orbiter] an ESA Cosmic Vision Mission currently in development. The  primary goal of Solar Orbiter is to understand how the Sun creates and controls the heliosphere. STIX will provide imaging spectroscopy of solar thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission. Through such measurements, STIX will provide quantitative information on the timing, location, intensity, and spectra of accelerated electrons as well as of high temperature thermal plasmas, mostly associated with flares. The goal of this project is to develop simulations of the count rates which will be detected by STIX over the course of its orbit around the Sun. These simulations will be based on past data provided by the RHESSI spacecraft which is currently in orbit. These simulations tools will become the foundation of a suite of open source simulation tools for designing future missions.<br/>
_Requirements_: Some scientific knowledge in X-ray astronomy is preferred.<br/>
_Mentor_: Säm Krucker<br/>

##  The PrepServer 

_Description_: Many solar data products are provided in raw form such that the calibration can be performed by the end user. This gives a certain amount of flexibility for the user but also makes it necessary for users to have access to large up to date calibration files which are necessary to perform the calibration. The PrepServer is a service which handles data calibration in the cloud maintaining flexibility but removing the onus from the user to download and maintain the software and datafiles necessary to perform the calibration. The goal of this project is to develop the software in Python to connect with the PrepServer through its API.<br/>
_Requirements_: Knowledge of Java and web services (WSDL, SOAP, etc.) is required.<br/>
_Mentor_: Laszlo Etesi<br/>

##  Plotman GUI 

_Description_: The goal of this project is to develop a standardized interface to plots such as that of lightcurves, spectrograms, or images. Such a tool would provide basic functionality to interact with the plots contained therein such as overlaying multiple images or comparing light curves to each other. This GUI interface could be written in either Tkinter or PyQT.<br/>
_Requirements_: Basic knowledge of GUI interface design.<br/>
_Mentor_: Steven Christe<br/>

##  HEK connectors 

_Description_: The immense volume of data generated by the suite of instruments on SDO has required new tools to efficiently identify and accessing data that is most relevant to research investigations. The [http://www.lmsal.com/hek/ Heliophysics Events Knowledgebase (HEK)] was developed to fill this need. The HER (Heliophysics Event Registry) system allows for submission of events and features found via automated data mining using feature-detection methods or detected ad-hoc. The HCR (Heliophysics Coverage Registry) contains instrument pointings and movies generated via the LMSAL cutout service.  [http://www.lmsal.com/hek/api.html Web services] and clients are provided for submitting items, searching the resulting metadata, and reviewing results. The goal of this project is to create a Python interface to these services.<br/>
_Requirements_: Familiarity with Python and web services (REST)<br/>
_Mentor_: David Pérez-Suárez; (with possible addition of subject matter expert Ankur Somani) <br/>

##  SDO JSOC Connector 

_Description_: The Solar Data Observatory's [http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ Joint Science Operations Center] is the authoritative source for data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).  Although most AIA and HMI data is available through the VSO, the JSOC's Data Records Management System (DRMS) contains additional lower-level data, and can support more complex queries that are used in helioseismology.  A [http://jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/AjaxJsocConnect RESTful webservice] is available to query the authoritative system, and a [http://jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/JsocDataAccess C API] exists to talk to [http://vso.stanford.edu/netdrms/ a local DRMS instance], such as the [http://vso.stanford.edu/netdrms/site_codes.html six mirrors in Europe].<br/>
_Requirements_: Knowledge of C required.  Knowledge of web services (REST) preferred.<br/>
_Mentor_: Joe Hourclé; (with possible addition of subject matter experts Art Amezcua and/or Igor Suárez Solá)<br/>

##  SDO Cutout Service 

_Description_: As part of the Heliophysics Coverage Registry (HER) Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory provides a [http://www.lmsal.com/get_aia_data/ ''cutout'' service] to access SDO/AIA data. This service reduces bandwidth costs by allowing users to request subsamples of full Sun images. This service also connects to the HEK so that users can find cutouts that others have made reducing the number of cutouts which need to be created. This service provides an API. The goal of this project is to create an interface to this service in Python as well as a GUI tool to choose the area of the cutout.<br/>
_Requirements_: Knowledge of web services preferred.<br/>
_Mentor_: Joe Hourclé (with possible addition of subject matter expert Ankur Somani)

##  SunPy and cloud computing 

_Description:_ The goal is to allow solar scientists to handle large-scale SunPy processing more easily and more quickly than is possible on a single desktop PC. This is particularly important for independent researchers who may not have access to institutional computing services.
The developer would extend SunPy to use [http://libcloud.apache.org/ libcloud] to provide the ability to run processing code at a large scale on private/public clouds. Related to this, the developer would create a virtual machine image containing SunPy libraries for use in the cloud.<br/>
_Requirements:_ Some prior virtualization / cloud computing experience would be useful.<br/>
_Mentor:_ David O'Callaghan (Trinity College Dublin)<br/>

##  High level image processing

_Description:_ Many of the image processing techniques used in solar physics are common in many other fields, and packages has been built for those like [http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ OpenCV] or [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ PIL].  The goal of this project is to port the functionality of those packages to SunPy so to apply them on solar images.<br/>
_Requirements:_ Familiarity with image processing concepts and image processing packages.<br/>
_Mentor:_ Alex Young<br/>

##  Blue Sky Ideas 

_Description_: [http://jhelioviewer.org/ JHelioviewer] is client software for the [http://www.helioviewer.org/wiki Helioviewer Project], solar image visualization and data access project. JHelioviewer is a Java-based client that provides data browsing capabilities, image overlaying, and can quickly make movie of these images as a function of time. This blue-sky project consists of porting the JHelioviewer client to Python and extending its capabilities.
