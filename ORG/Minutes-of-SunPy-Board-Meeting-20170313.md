### Minutes of Meeting

- **Lead developer:**
  - Board votes to renew **Stuart** as the Lead Developer of SunPy. **Vote is 7-0 in favour**.
  - As a side note, Stuart suggests that some developer tasks could be split up into different roles.

- **Board performance:**
  - Discussion regarding the current performance of the board. There is concern that the board has not been as engaged with the community this year. This is important as the board is supposed to represent the community.
  - Ways to improve interaction with the community are discussed. For example, more communication through sunpy and solar physics related mailing lists regarding SunPy activities, e.g. new Board member opportunities, current projects.
  - The need for an **Outreach/Communications officer** is suggested. **Jack** volunteers to fill this role.
  - The board is also not very active between official meetings. This could be improved through more discussion of current issues on the board mailing list or via IRC/Slack.

- **Board membership:**
  - The composition of the board is due to change, so it was decided to hold of on re-allocating Board roles (e.g. Chair, Secretary) until the new members take their posts. **Voted that current role occupants will continue until the next meeting (7-0 in favour).**
  - **Tom Robitaille** is rotating off the board, and will be replaced.
  - Two potential new board members are **Sabrina Savage** (MSFC) and **Monica Bobra** (Stanford).
  - **Andy** volunteers to step down from the role of Secretary and from the Board. It is agreed that he will stay on until the next meeting, when a new member will take on the Secretary role.
  - Vote on **Sabrina** joining the board: **7-0 in favour**.
  - Vote on **Monica** joining the board: **7-0 in favour**.
  - It is generally agreed that, in the future, open positions on the Board should be advertised to the community to solicit interest and wider engagement with the community.

    Meeting adjourns.
