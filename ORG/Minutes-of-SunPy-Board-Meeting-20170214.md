**Absent**: Tom Robitaille

### Agenda

- NumFOCUS
- Board membership

### Minutes of Meeting

- **Discussion continues about joining NumFocus**:
  - NumFocus has provided an updated Financial Sponsorship Agreement (FSA). This agreement sets all current SunPy board members as the steering committee for the NumFocus project.
  - This means that any new Board members must also join the steering committee, entering into a legal agreement.
  - people sign the FSA as individuals (i.e. not on behalf of institutions)
  - SunPy would become a legal entity under NumFocus.
  - transfers ownership of SunPy to NumFocus.
  - Trademark would transfer to NumFocus
  - If individuals win grants to work on SunPy e.g. through NSF or NASA, that money does not have to go through NumFocus, it can go through e.g. a university. So it would not affect our ability to win grants to work on SunPy related code/projects.
  - **Steven** suggests that joining NumFocus should be a unanimous decision by all board members

- Board votes on whether decision on the NumFocus agreement has to be unanimous, and that vote shall take place by email. **Result is 9-0 in favour**.

- **Board membership:**
  - Some current Board members have expired terms.
  - **Board votes in favour** to hold an email vote for renewal of current Board members with expired terms.
  - **Kevin** departs.
  - Russ says he is willing to step down from the Board, although it is pointed out that he has the most computational background of the current membership.
  - Potential new board members are Sabrina Savage (NASA/MSFC) and Monica Bobra (Stanford).
  - **Albert** suggests that at a future meeting the performance of the Board is discussed, e.g. whether the Board is doing an adequate job of moving SunPy forward.

    Meeting adjourns.
