**Absent**: Tom Robitaille

### Agenda
  - NumFOCUS
  - Board membership

### Minutes of Meeting
  - **Discussion continues about joining NumFocus**:
    - NumFocus has provided an updated Financial Sponsorship Agreement (FSA). This agreement sets all current SunPy board members as the steering committee for the NumFocus project.
    - This means that any new Board members must also join the steering committee, entering into a legal agreement.
    - people sign the FSA as individuals (i.e. not on behalf of institutions)
    - SunPy would become a legal entity under NumFocus.
    - transfers ownership of SunPy to NumFocus.
    - Trademark would transfer to NumFocus
    - If individuals win grants to work on SunPy e.g. through NSF or NASA, that money does not have to go through NumFocus, it can go through e.g. a university. So it would not affect our ability to win grants to work on SunPy related code/projects.
    - **Steven** suggests that joining NumFocus should be a unanimous decision by all board members     	

	
  - Board votes on whether decision on the NumFocus agreement has to be unanimous, and that vote shall take place by email. **Result is 9-0 in favour**.


  - **Board membership:**
    - Some current Board members have expired terms.
    - **Board votes in favour** to hold an email vote for renewal of current Board members with expired terms.
    - **Kevin** departs.
    - Russ says he is willing to step down from the Board, although it is pointed out that he has the most computational background of the current membership.
    - Potential new board members are Sabrina Savage (NASA/MSFC) and Monica Bobra (Stanford).
    - **Albert** suggests that at a future meeting the performance of the Board is discussed, e.g. whether the Board is doing an adequate job of moving SunPy forward.
  

    Meeting adjourns.
