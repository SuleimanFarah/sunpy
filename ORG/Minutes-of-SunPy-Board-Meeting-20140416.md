- Discussion of what we should consider when proposing to add new board members. Current guidelines limit the size of the board to 10. Current size is 8, will increase to 9 with election of an additional member.
- Noted that it would also be possible, instead of adding board members, to create an â€˜advisory board/panel' that could advise the SunPy board as needed.
- Voting procedes. **Tom Robitaille** elected unanimously (5-0) to the SunPy board.
- Discussion on proxy voting. Need to establish a system for absent board members to vote by proxy.
