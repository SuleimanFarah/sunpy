### Meeting Notes

- Discussion about appointing a **new Lead Developer**. We need to appoint an interim lead developer, as **Stuart** is stepping down. **Steven** argues that the main purpose of the position is to be responsible for the SunPy code base, and that it is important that the position is occupied at all times.
  - **Albert** is nominated as interim Lead Developer.
  - **Vote on Albert as interim Lead Developer. 7-1 in favour.**

- Discussion on the **Affiliated packages SEP**.
  - Affiliation is a formal mechanism of including projects managed by others in the SunPy Community, for example instrument software pipelines. Agreed that this SEP should only outline the fundamental concept of Affiliated Packages, not all the details.
  - **Vote proceeds. 8-0 in favour.**

- **Albert** and **Juan** left the meeting.

- **Vote on the Coordinates SEP.** 6-0 in favour.

- Discussion on the Unified Downloader SEP.
  - Decided to hold a vote by email at a later date on this SEP (decided by 5-0 vote)

Meeting concludes.
