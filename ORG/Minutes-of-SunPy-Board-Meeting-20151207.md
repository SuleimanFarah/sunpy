  - **Russell** is happy to stay on. Hopeful he will have more time to contribute in the future. But doesn't want to be an impediment to progress.
  - **Andy** also happy to stay on.
  - **Stuart** also is ok to renew board membership.
  - **Tom suggests that he step down**, having been on the board for 2 years. He suggests we could find an alternative AstroPy developer to take his place.
    - agreement that having someone from AstroPy on the Board is important.
    - **Tom** will stay on until a replacement is found. Board members will reach out to the AstroPy community to source a replacement

- the board **authorises an offline vote** about renewing membership for the above Board members for a 2-year term.
  - vote: **5-0 in favour**

**David Perez-Suarez** joined the meeting

- discussion of **Numfocus** (nonprofit status)
  - Numfocus is a nonprofit organization
  - SunPy could join this - means can accept money (donations, grants)
  - could also set up a non-profit on our own. Probably would use an attorney for this. Might be expensive. This would avoid Numfocus overhead, but not clear which is the better approach.
  - need pluses and minuses of Numfocus. Not clear at the moment.
  - Numfocus overhead e.g. if AstroPy received $10,000, 7% goes to Numfocus + some base charge. Total approximately 10%. Rate goes down as the amount donated increases. For $1M, it would be around 5%. Might be room to negotiate amounts.
  - Numfocus seems easier overall.
  - Copyright issues
  - **Stuart** offers to open a dialogue with Numfocus.

- **Funding opportunities update**
  - no funds available at NASA Goddard
  - pursuing possible funding from NASA HQ
  - host another SunPy workshop at SPD
  - prepare open letter asking for funding?!

**Meeting adjourns**
