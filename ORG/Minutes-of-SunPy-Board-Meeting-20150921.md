### Meeting Notes

- It is **proposed to add a new member to the SunPy Board - Kevin Reardon**. Kevin is part of the DKIST team.
  - DKIST project is already invested/interested in Python.
  - It is noted that under current rules the board size **cannot exceed 10 people**. Kevin would be the 10th board member.
  - as an aside, a number of board members terms are due to expire on 31st December 2015. Those members are **Andy**, **Russell** and **Stuart**

  - **Vote proceeds** on appointment of Kevin Reardon as a SunPy board member:
           **7-0 (1 abstention) in favour of Kevin joining the SunPy Board**

- Discussion on **Numfocus**
  - Numfocus could provide a fiscal mechanism for dealing with SunPy as a distinct entity (i.e. funding/donations).
  - SunPy must act to further the tax-exempt goals of Numfocus. SunPy would become part of numfocus and they would be our legal entity.
  - Some questions on how would this work in terms of grant applications. Need some clarification.
  - the Board needs more time to research numfocus. Steven suggests we plan a vote for the next meeting.
  - **Russell** suggests there should be public consultation with the wider SunPy community.

- Student projects
  - **David** wants to discuss how we can improve our mentorship of summer students. Skip this for now and address at a Dev meeting instead.

- Dev community
  - Community has been quiet since 0.6 release. Seems that there are new members of the community who need more active support.
  - issue is that most of the current developers are short of time. Need to make sure to encourage newer members.

- **Lead Developer**
  - **Albert** volunteers to step down as Lead Developer due to lack of time.
  - Vote on re-installing **Stuart** as lead developer:
       **6-0 in favour (2 abstentions). Stuart is the new Lead Developer**.

- **Russell** departs

- Meeting transparency
  - under current rules, board meetings are semi-private, but people should be able to come and observe.
  - **Stuart** suggests better advertising that Board meetings are happening, so people can know when to request attendance.
  - distribute info to the main sunpy lists, but not things like solar news
  - no need to have videos online.

- **Steven** departs

- Funding opportunities
  - **Jack** and **Steven** will be talking to Michael Hesse next week about funding for SunPy. Michael Hesse is the Heliophyics Division Director at Goddard.

- Meeting adjourns
