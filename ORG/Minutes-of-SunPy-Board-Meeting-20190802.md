### Agenda

Received, three applications for board membership.

- _Voted_ on new board members
  - New board member: Tiago M. D. Pereira
  - New board member: Bin Chen
- _Voted_ on lead developer (existing term had expired). Unanimous for extending Stuart Mumford's term for 1 year.

General discussion notes
- Consensus is that more applicants for the positions would have been preferred. Discussion took place on whether we should only accept 1 applicant to give more time for other applicant but given that the next time terms end is in March of 2020 decided which is fairly soon it was not worth waiting. _BUT_ we should do a better job and start the process of recruiting new members earlier!
- Original board members should have to re-apply and be evaluated with all other applicants.
- May need a document/report that spells out the plus and minuses of being an affiliated package given that there are new potential affiliated packages coming soon.
- Key point from Russ, is that one of the most important aspects of the SunPy project is setting up the right structures, workflows, and processes. These processes will outlive programming languages.
