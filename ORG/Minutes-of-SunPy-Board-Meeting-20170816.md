* Issues
  * Hosting for documentation. Current build takes a lot of time due to the gallery. Problem with stalling during builds. We are at the limit of how much free build time readthedocs can provide. Should we move away from readthedocs? Stuart suggested that he could possibly do the hosting, but not feasible for time and money. Looking for other suggestions
