## IRIS Integration
**Abstract**: The [IRIS](http://iris.lmsal.com) observes the chromosphere and transition region
of the Sun with high spatial and time resolution. The primary goal of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) explorer is to understand how the solar atmosphere is energized. The IRIS mission produces data through
a slit-jaw imager which can take images of the Sun at various wavelengths as well as a line spectrograph which
rasters over an image to build up an image. This project aims to integrate IRIS data into SunPy. This includes the following tasks.

1. Integration of IRIS data search and querying
2. Adding the ability to read IRIS data files into their proper data objects
3. Developing a data browser module in the existing SUnPy GUI for fast inspection of IRIS data 

**Requirements**: Python and basic knowledge of GUI design. 

**Expected Outcomes**: IRIS Mapcube class, IRIS Spectrum class, GUI data browser module

**Idea from:**: Steven Christe (NASA GSFC, SunPy)

* **Mentor**: Steven Christe (NASA GSFC, SunPy), Joel Allred (NASA GSFC)

## Integration of the HESPE Data Archive
* **Description**: The [HESPE Data Archive](http://hespe.eu/browser) gives access
to pre-processed science products from the RHESSI satellite. 
The data are organized by flare event and are available both as printable quicklook 
files (PNGs) that can be directly displayed in SunPy, and in their original data 
structures and formats (FITS) that may need some additional processing. 
Access is provided through a web interface (REST) that can be used from within SunPy. 
Each flare event can have hundreds of data products connected to it, which requires 
special attention when displaying the search results. 
The integration task includes: 
(1) basic integration of the HESPE search (with feedback to the HESPE project team,
if necessary); 
(2) basic integration of the RHESSI data products using existing SunPy structures; 
(3) optimizing the handling and presentation of the search, the search results 
(e.g. allowing to filter), and the data products themselves. 
The outcome should be two clients, command-line and GUI.

* **Requirements**: Knowledge of GUI design; Basic knowledge of working with web 
services (REST) and JSON is a plus.

* **Mentor**: Laszlo I. Etesi (HESPE data archive developer), Steven Christe (SunPy)

## HELIO - capabilities improvement

### Description:

SunPy has already the capability to access to the Heliophysics Events Catalogue provided by the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory.  This catalogue provides access to different lists of events observed anywhere in the heliosphere.  However, HELIO offers a lot more web services of interest for the solar community.  Some of the services can provide information of when and where a planet or instrument where located, properties on features detected on the sun, or properties of some heliospheric observations; moreover it also allow the discovery of new data by a propagation model which simulates three different scenarios - Coronal Mass Ejections, High speed solar wind and Solar Energetic Particles events.

This project would consist in the creation of an interface to access to HELIO services in a similar way that other services like HEK or VSO are accessible at the moment. HELIO uses VOTables as the standard to transfer the data, astropy provides support for reading such file format, therefore some understanding of astropy may be needed.   

* Requirements: All the services from HELIO are through webservices (SOAP, REST), thus some understanding on that would be beneficial. VOTable parser provided from astropy will be used, so familiarization with such interface will be helpful.

* Difficulty: Medium

* Mentors: David Perez-Suarez, (Marco Soldati, Kevin Benson - HELIO)

## Feature Tracking / Detection

Framework and algorithms for detecting features in the solar atmosphere / magnetic fields on the solar surface.

Detection algorithms:

* Thresholding
* Clumping
* Downhill
* Curve

Tracking and property extraction using labelling and similar. 

## HEK searching and overlays in Ginga

Query the HEK both manually and automatically from ginga and overlay the results on the images

## Downloader integration with Database and Ginga

Replace the VSO integration in the database module with the Unified Downloader and then integrate full querying in a Ginga plugin.

## Refactor and Factory Spectrogram

Build a Spectra() factory and refactor the whole `sunpy.spectra` module to pull it inline with Map and LightCurve.

## Interface to get heliospheric data from CDAweb

CDAWEB provides as [SOAP interface](http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/SOAP/) which could be used
within SunPy to download insitu data.
