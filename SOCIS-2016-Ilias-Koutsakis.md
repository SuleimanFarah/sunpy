## Background / Work Experience
I am a senior student of Computer Science in University of Athens, Greece, and expecting to start a Masters Degree in Data Science in September. I am currently employed at CERN, working on [InspireHEP](https://github.com/inspirehep) which is the largest global digital library for High Energy Physics, with over 50.000 users worldwide, including various well known institutions (DESY, Stanford University, etc). The general work direction of the InspireHEP group is completely data oriented, including machine learning projects, crawling and data extraction, data model implementation/configuration and search configuration.

My interests lie in the field of data engineering / data mining, and my ongoing thesis, [Clusterix](https://github.com/Lilykos/clusterix) is an ETL project commissioned by the CERN GS group on the field of clustering and visual analytics. In my everyday work I make use of **a variety of different data/ml Python libraries, like scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, numpy, etc.** I feel that my experience in data-centered projects, as well as my use of software best practices (documentation, testing, teamwork), will result in well-documented, tested and readable code for the new Lightcurve implementation.

#### Thesis Project (Clusterix)
Clusterix is a web-based visual analytics tool that aspires to support clustering tasks by users, while having analysts at the center of the workflow. Clusterix provides the facilities to:
* Load and preview JSON, CSV, or XML data;
* select columns to be considered by the clustering algorithm and modify weights;
* select and run one or more clustering algorithms (kÂ­means, hierarchical clustering) with varying parameters;
* view and interact with the results in a browser environment;
* modify the parameters or input data to correct the clustering output. 

Such an iterative, visual analytics approach allows users to quickly determine the best clustering algorithm and   parameters for their data, and to correct any errors in the clustering output. Clusterix has been applied to the clustering of heterogeneous data sets, in particular to the clustering of author affiliations in publications, for a recommendation system on InspireHEP.

## Other Info
#### Available Platforms
Microsoft Windows 7, Ubuntu Linux (both 64-bit)

#### Availability
I am available all day long. Currently i am working, so I check my mails regularly until the afternoon. During the summer, I will also be available for the bigger part of the day, as I will not be working and will be able to fully commit on the project.
