## Background / Work Experience
I am a sophomore student of Computer Science in University of Athens, Greece, and expecting to start a Masters Degree in Data Science in September. I am currently employed at CERN, working on [InspireHEP](https://github.com/inspirehep) which is the largest global digital library for High Energy Physics, with over 50.000 users worldwide, including various well known institutions (DESY, Stanford University, etc).

My interests lie in the field of data engineering / data mining, and my ongoing thesis, [Clusterix](https://github.com/Lilykos/clusterix) is an ETL project commissioned by the CERN GS group on the field of clustering and visual analytics.
