# ESA Summer of code in Space
## What is it?
> [ESA Summer of Code in Space](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis/) is a program run by the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/ESA).
>It aims at offering student developers stipends to write code for various space-related open source software projects.
>Through SOCIS, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios.
>In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.

SunPy has participated in the last seven editions (2011 - 2017).
During these editions SunPy has obtained a big push in the development and gained new members that have stuck to the core of SunPy.
Don't doubt to find a project you would like to do and apply for it (some time soon!).

**The requirements for students who want to apply are the same as [[GSoC]] (pay particular attention to [[GSoC: Advice for Students]]).**
