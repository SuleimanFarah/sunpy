# Background

I study aerospace computer science at Würzburg university. During the bachelor I had some image processing courses or exercise which involved mostly matlab and raw
mage data. With sikit, I am mostly familiar with scikit-learn which I used for NLTK (See my Github). During last month I also get my self to work with scikit-image for
NASA space App challenge I was working on to use neural networks and scikit-image for machine learning. During master I had radar and optics course which also contain
lot of matrix manipulations and processing which I used to solve in Matlab. As a part time developer at the university, I am familiar with different object oriented
anguage mostly ruby, python or php.

# Idea

Increase SunPy's Image processing capability, image alignment, rotation and warping.

# Time-line

## Week 1/2

Getting familiar with sunpy and scikit image.
Find the difference between sunpy.image.Crotate and skimage.transform
## Week 3/6
Writing the equivalent of C code with the help of scikit-image
Writing test cases.
## Week 7/8
Working on fine-alignment problem
Writing test cases
## Week 8/10
Working on the last part of the purpose idea which involves analysis of sun surface futures.
Writing test case
## Week 11/12
Working on what's left or missing.
## Week 13/14
