# ESA Summer of code in Space
# What is it?
> [ESA Summer of Code in Space](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2013/) is a program run by the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int). It aims at offering student developers stipends to write code for various space-related open source software projects. Through SOCIS, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.

SunPy has participated in the last two editions (2011 and 2012).  During these two edition SunPy has obtained a big push in the development and gained new members that have stuck to the core of SunPy.  This year SunPy is applying again! Don't doubt to find a project you would like to do and apply for it (from the 30th of June).

Good luck!
