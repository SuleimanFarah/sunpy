# ESA Summer of code in Space
# What is it?
> [ESA Summer of Code in Space](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis/) is a program run by the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int). It aims at offering student developers stipends to write code for various space-related open source software projects. Through SOCIS, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.

SunPy has participated in the last sixeditions (2011 - 2016).  During these editions SunPy has obtained a big push in the development and gained new members that have stuck to the core of SunPy.  This year SunPy is applying again! Don't doubt to find a project you would like to do and apply for it (some time soon!).

Good luck!
