# SOCIS 2019

* [[SOCIS 2019 Organization Application]] and [[ideas information | SOCIS 2019 Ideas Information]].

This year [SOCIS](https://socis.esa.int/) is slightly different than its previous editions. Now
there is [no restriction of where the student is studying](https://socis.esa.int/frequently-asked-questions/).

As you may come here from GSoC, make sure you check the [SOCIS
timeline](https://socis.esa.int/timeline/) as the coding period are not the same, and note that
the [stipend is also different](https://socis.esa.int/frequently-asked-questions/).
A part of these differences, the requirements from SunPy **are the same*** than for [[GSoC]]
(pay particular attention to [[GSoC: Advice for Students]]).

SOCIS application is very short (300 words), however, we require a more detailed
application posted below. Use the [[GSoC Application template | GSoC: Student
Application Template]] as a basis for your application. Note that for your
application to be considered you need to post your application below and to
apply via the [SOCIS platform](https://socis.esa.int/students/). Don't forget
that you have also to do a contribution to SunPy before the deadline.
