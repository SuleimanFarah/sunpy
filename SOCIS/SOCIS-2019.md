# SOCIS 2019

* [[SOCIS 2019 Organization Application]] and [[ideas information | SOCIS 2019 Ideas Information]].

This year [SOCIS](https://socis.esa.int/) is slightly different than its previous editions. Now
there is [no restriction of where the student is studying](https://socis.esa.int/frequently-asked-questions/).

As you may come here from GSoC, make sure you check the [SOCIS
timeline](https://socis.esa.int/timeline/) as the coding period are not the same, and note that
the [stipend is also different](https://socis.esa.int/frequently-asked-questions/).
A part of these differences, the requirements from SunPy are the same than for [[GSoC]]
(pay particular attention to the [[GSoC: Advice for Students]] and [[GSoC: Student Application Guidelines]]).

Add your application below using the [[GSoC Application template | GSoC: Student
Application Template]] as a basis for your application. However, note that for
your application to be considered you need to apply via the [SOCIS
platform](https://socis.esa.int/students/).
