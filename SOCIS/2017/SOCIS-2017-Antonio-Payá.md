Skills
==========
I've experience with many programming languages ​​(Python, Java, C#, C, Javascript, etc) In addition to other more scientific like R or Matlab.
About Python, I've knowledge about its numeric calculation libraries like (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, etc) and about Qt.
Other areas in which I've experience is web development, databases and software for robots.


Proposal
========
I want to try develop "Sunkit-image", especially:
1. Port the Multi-Scale Gaussian Normalisation code from [#1899](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1899).
2. Convert the [differential rotation code](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/master/sunpy/physics/differential_rotation.py) in SunPy to use [`sunpy.coordinates`](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/tree/master/sunpy/map).
3. Implement image warping for solar differential rotation. [#1876](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/1876).
4. Implement the [OCCULT-2 algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5046) for coronal loop tracing.
5. Implement running and base difference functionality and the persistence transform. See Figure 2 in [this paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/102/pdf) for some ideas.


Timeline
========
- Until May 31: Study the sources of `SunPy` profoundly and everything related to astronomy and solar physics data.
- Week 1/2: Study how to develop the algorithm.
- Week 3/4/5: Start coding.
- Week 5: Test the API.
- Week 6: Investigate how to parallelize the algorithm (In case that is possible).
- Week 7/8/9: Parallelize the algorithm as much as possible and reduce their execution times.
- Week 10: Validation and testing (test cases).
- Week 11: Look for possible improvements.
- Week 12: Documentation.

Extra info
==========
- Native Platforms: Linux and Windows 10.
- Availability: From 9:00 to 9:00. (UTC+1, UTC+2 during summer).
