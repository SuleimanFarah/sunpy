Studies: I'm finishing my Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, and also studying a CFGS (the Spanish equivalent of Higher Vocational Training Course) in Web Application Development.

OS: Mainly Linux and Windows, but also MacOS if needed.

# Background and skills
I have been interested in Computer Science since I was a child, and started programming with Visual Basic, making little programs and GUIs, and learning the basics of C, C++ and Java in the highschool. When I finished highschool, I decided to study Aerospace Engineering. Although I specialized in Air Navigation, and I had programming subjects, learning specific languages like Ada, I wanted to learn more about app development, so I decided to enroll in a Web Application Development CFGS, which I am currently studying.

Thanks to that dual education I have learned to use tools like Git, RDBMSs, and Unix environments, as well as languages like Java, C, C++, Matlab, Python and Ada, and markup languages.

# Proposal
I would like to work on 'X-ray VIsibility Synthesis ImagiNg or Xray-VISION'.

My plan consists of creating pure python implementations, given that wrappers around existing implementations can be a real headache from my point of view.

I have Fourier Transform knowledge thanks to my engineer background, and I'll be using `Scipy` which is already a `Sunpy` dependency.
# Timeline
* Week 1: Research about aperture synthesis and specifically the CLEAN method, as well as familiarize myself with Scipy structure. Also discuss with my mentor about this proposal.
* Week 2-4: Start the development, firstly creating suitable representation for generalised visibilities.
* Week 5-7: Implement the CLEAN method, with docs and tests.
* Week 8-9: Integrate the resulting images with the `sunpy.map.Map` object, as stated in the Ideas Page.
* Week 10: Research about the implementation of the more advanced methods, and decide which ones, if any, are going to be developed.
* Week 11-12: Implement decided advanced method(s) and/or check the existent code for bugs, optimization...
* Week 13: Review with my mentor if SOCIS goals have been achieved.
