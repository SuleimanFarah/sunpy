## Project Name:
SunPy

## HowOrganization Description: 

SunPy is a community-developed, free and open-source solar data analysis
environment for Python. The goal of SunPy is to enable anyone to use and analyze
solar data expanding therefore the community.

# Project Ideas

## Space Weather forecasting using machine learning
### Brief Description:
Use the [Sunspotter dataset](http://sunspotter.org/) to create a model that will
forecast solar flare events using new space observations of solar active
regions.

## Expand the scope of solarbextrapolation.
### Brief Description:
Improve the [solarbextrapolation](https://github.com/sunpy/solarbextrapolation) package by relaxing the small-angle approximation and allowing for extrapolation of global magnetic fields.

## What is the web-page where a detailed description of your project can be found?


## Please describe the work you want to be performed by a SOCIS student on your project ? (short summary)

We propose two projects for this summer, both involve the creation of new tools to
ease the analysis of solar physics data through python. 
- The first project is about X-ray synthesis imaging techniques to apply it in
the STIX instrument for the future ESA's mission Solar Orbiter. 
- The second project has a wider scope, it is the development of a image
processing module for SunPy. This will be of great use for any solar imager in
any wavelength and it will start by translating into python some of the more
important algorithms described in the literature.

## Give a link to a web-page describing the suject of this work with more details
https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/SOCIS-2017

## Name and role in the project of the person who will mentor the SOCIS student

- Shane Maloney, PostDoc at Trinity College Dublin. Member of the Data reduction & Archiving for SOLO/STIX.
- Jack Ireland, Lead Support Scientist at GSFC. Core developer of SunPy.
- David Perez-Suarez, Research Software Developer at UCL. Core developer of SunPy.

## Please list the skills required by the student

- Programming in a high-level general-purpose language (Java, C#, Python...)
- Maths, Physics, Space
- Other: Understanding of image processing will help
