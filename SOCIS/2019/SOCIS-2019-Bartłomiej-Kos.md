Education
Graduating from University's of Wrocław faculty of Physics and Astronomy I received the title of engineer of physics. While studying, for five out of seven semesters I was collecting a scholarship granted for academic performance. The subject of my thesis was Electronic Measurement System of Wilberforce Pendulum which was published last year in European Journal of Physics. The project, being interdisciplinary, required me to use the knowledge and skills gained in the fields of physics, electronics and programming. As for now I am a master degree student in computational physics who leverages deep learning achievements to cosmological parameter estimation..
Interest in Open Astronomy
As a physicist I find it essential to grasp the nature of things. I am particularly interested in working for you because it is an impactful business that has the chance to shape world to be a better, safer place. Being a person who adores challenges, I hope that on the position I would have an opportunity to gain experience, skills and knowledge in the field of machine learning. During the journey with my master thesis I have dealt with similar issues/tasks and by working with you I would like to enlarge my expertise.
Title
Space Weather forecasting using machine learning.




Summary
Entrusted tasks I used to fulfill conscientiously; I am a hungry for knowledge and skills especially in the fields of learning techniques and artificial intelligence; deficiencies of experience I make up with work and independent, deep exploration of the topic.
Description/timeline
At first, I would get to know the data as well as tools & python libraries that are considered to be state-of-art in dealing with such tasks. In the meantime I would opt to get familiar with the current research in the topic. Later on, systematically I would deploy and test various machine learning approaches. In the end I would create a summary of those and provide with documentation on how to use the model.
Schedule availability
I am available since the beginning of July 2019.
