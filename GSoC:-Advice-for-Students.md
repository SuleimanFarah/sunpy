Do you want to participate in SunPy as part of GSoC?
Then try to follow these steps for applying to GSoC with SunPy.

1. **The better we know you, the better we can evaluate you.**

    There are many ways to get yourself known by the community.
    You can introduce yourself through the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/sunpy), chat with us in the [Matrix channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#sunpy:matrix.org) and even contact the mentors to know more about the project that interested you.
    We strongly recommend you browse [Shakthi Kannan's book "i want 2 do project. tell me wat 2 do"](http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/book/chapter1.pdf).

2. **Be a Sunpy user!**

    Do you want to be a developer for SunPy?
    Then you have to understand the solar physics community but don't Panic!
    Solar physics is a quite broad scientific area, but to understand most of our needs you don't need to know much about the physics but the data we want to analyze.
    For example, some of our data are images of the whole Sun at a certain wavelength, however other instruments may observe the whole Sun as a single star producing time series.
    To get an understanding of SunPy, browse through the [documentation and the user guide](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/index.html).
    You can also check all the [different posters we have done](http://figshare.com/articles/search?q=sunpy&quick=1).

3. **Set yourself up as a developer.**

    You will need to create yourself an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).
    If you don't know how to use [git](http://www.git-scm.com/),
    don't worry, it's easy and there are lots of [tutorials](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) [online](http://gitimmersion.com/) that will help you to get quite confident with git in a short amount of time.
    The next step is to install SunPy and for this we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
    You can find more information [on our developers guide](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/newcomers.html).
    Please try to use SunPy, you will gain a much better understanding of how SunPy works by actually using it and follow some of the examples in the documentation, to get a better idea of what it can do.

4. **Start to be a developer.**

    Check our [issues list](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/labels/Package%20Novice) to see if there is something that you could do.
    **You need to submit at least one pull request to SunPy if you want to be considered for GSoC.**
    **We use the pull requests as a basis to judge your ability to program Python or other relevant languages.**
    Familiarize yourself with the [development guidelines](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/index.html) for SunPy and the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).
    The developer documentation contains a lot of information on using git (including rebasing), how to write tests, documentation, etc.
    The more understanding of the workflow you can demonstrate, the better your chances.

5. **Plan your application.**

    Review our [ideas page](http://openastronomy.org/gsoc/) to see if you find a project that is interesting to you.
    Make sure to look at the SunPy ones!

    Prepare a plan on how you will tackle that project and the time it will take you to solve it.
    Do not worry much in providing exact dates, but plan it as best as you can.
    Please read our [[Application Guidelines | GSoC: Student Application Guidelines]] and make sure your application follows the 
    [template](https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/GSoC/blob/master/application_students.md) (feel free to add more information as asked
    in our future [[template | GSoC: Student Application Template]]).

    Take the initiative!
    We can send you information on the projects and feedback on the applications, but it is your responsibility to ask the questions and start preparing your application.
    We will let you know if something is missing from your application or if any of the goals are unrealistic, but we will not write the application.

6. **Review your application**

    We suggest putting your application on the SunPy wiki for reviewing.
    This lets people who aren't on the GSoC website review your application, and it also is much easier to read things in the wiki than on the GSoC website.
    Please feel free to add your application to the wiki following this format: "GSoC-\<Year\>-\<Your Name\>".
    If you apply for more than one project please add the project name at the end.
    Then you can link the page on the corresponding GSoC \<Year\> page.
    You can look at the older years to see how it works.

7. **Submit your application.**

    Please remember that you **MUST SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION ON THE GSoC WEBSITE**.
    It is not possible to accept you if you do not do this.
    Google will not accept late applications for any reason, so get them in there.
    There have been issues in the past with submissions right up at the deadline, so submit your application early.

Following these points will assure you to be high rated and don't hesitate to ask us anything.
Please make sure to check the other GSoC wiki pages!

Best of luck to everyone!
