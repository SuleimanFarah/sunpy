## Astropy integration

* Description: 
Astropy is a core package for astronomy. A lot of the code in astropy is diectly applicable to SunPy. This project's aim is to tighten the integration between astropy and SunPy. This includes making SunPy support `astropy.units` everywhere in the code base where it is applicable. Designing and building a new version of `sunpy.coords` that is based on `astropy.coordinates`. This project will involve a lot of interaction with the Astropy project and probably some development on that code base.
