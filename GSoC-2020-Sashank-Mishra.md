### Interest In OpenAstronomy

I developed a strong interest in the field of Astrophysics and High Energy Physics, ever since I went to do my internship at IUCAA, Pune, India, and interacted with the community there. By attending the introductory summer school on Astrophysics, I have a basic theoretical understanding as well.

OpenAstronomy provides an opportunity to explore the domain of Astronomy, which lines up my passion in the field of Astronomy and interest in Computer Science together. With the advent of increased precision and sensitivity of astronomical interests and better storage options, Astronomy is now one of the domains which are highly data-intensive and is getting more and more data. Therefore, it invites the creation of a community that can effectively handle, manipulate and provides all the resources as required, and OpenAstronomy does that job by the creation of various community-led packages like AstroPy, SunPy, HelioPy, and many others.

Solar Astronomy is what excites me the most in the field of Astronomy, and SunPy provides me the platform of working in that domain. Also, the usage of Python invites a larger community of astronomers and software developers alike, as it is the most sought-after and supported language in the open-source community. Therefore, SunPy provides me to explore my domain of interest, while working with an awesome community of developers and scientists.



### Contribution to SunPy

I have been involved with the SunPy project for the 3 months, contributing since December 2019.

## Abstract

SunPy provides an excellent module for someone who is interested in solar physical analysis. It includes the feature to get required FITS files from various data sources, plot them in a script and perform certain manipulations. But for users, who have no experience with python code-development, viewing and manipulation become tough, as they have to understand the underlying API of the SunPy first. To deal with this scenario, a new GUI is to be developed, known as *glue-solar*.

Glue-solar is an application developed on top of Qt, which is built on the lines of glue-astronomy, to provide an interactive and user-friendly platform for solar-physical data. Currently, the glue-solar is not actively maintained, has just the basic implementation and no official release. Also, it has no documentation for the users.

This project will focus on the development of features and documentation of glue-solar in such a way that it easily provides an interface for the users to load their FITS files and view the images and/or metadata associated with it.


### Proposed Methodology

Glue-solar will act as the GUI Interface for solar-physical data, on the lines of SunPy. Therefore, glue-solar will support the loading up of solar-physical data from various sources such as AIA, SDO, IRIS, and others. Also, different plugins would be created to handle and visualize the data.

Currently, the glue-solar is not well-maintained, having no active release, and almost no documentation. Therefore, it would be necessary to develop the documentation using Sphinx, with all necessary images, and screencasts. This would provide a baseline for future developers and other astronomers to work on this project. Also, a release would be done for the users to download the plugin from PyPi itself. So, the main aim would be the proper documentation so that we can involve a large community of developers to get started on the extension of this project in the future. 

Glue-solar will develop a plugin that will load the data as an NDCube object. That NDCube object will easily support basic operations such as slicing while preserving the WCS. In this way, it can easily support basic data as well as AIA `mapsequence`.

For data from IRIS, it should ideally support both raster and SJI data and should provide linking between them. Also, glue-solar should be able to create level-3 FITS from the combination of level-2 files from FITS, while preserving the metadata. For all these purposes, we will use NDCube throughout the glue-solar to load and store the data. Also, custom methods from IRISPy, such as extraction of level-2 fits from raster, and the combination would be used to manipulate data.



## Timeline

#### May 5 -June 1: Community Bonding


- I will spend my time exploring the Glue framework and its API, mainly focusing on its extension and creation of various customizable plugins.
  
- I will also start understanding the workflow of releases, and documentation building using sphinx.

- I will also understand the workflow and usage of NDCube and IRISPy and how it can be easily implemented in the plugin.

- I will remain in constant touch with mentors so as to discuss and finalize on any modifications in the roadmap for the project.

- Meanwhile, I will continue my contribution to SunPy and will also start contributing to NDCube.

#### June 1 - June 29: Phase 1 Coding

##### June 1 - June 15:
- The main aim of this phase would be to understand the current scope of the project and do the necessary changes so as to create a beta release.

- This involves the creation of the documentation and screenshots wherever necessary.

- The README would be updated so as any user can install it easily in development mode.

##### June 15 - June 29:
- I would start with the creation of the data loader plugin, which would use the existing NDCube framework so as to load the FITS data from various sources.

- The framework would be able to support basic data loading from simple sources such as AIA, HMI, and others, as an NDCube object. 

- Relevant tests and documentation would be created.

#### June 29 - July 3: Phase 1 Evaluations

#### July 3 - July 27: Phase 2 Coding

##### July 3 - July 15:

- Glue currently has an option of the creation of a subset of original data from the plot. Since the NDCube supports slicing while preserving the WCS properties, I will extend the existing subset creation to incorporate NDCube data as well. The new method would be more suitable for solar data.

- Also, currently, the 1D profile viewer plots the values of an axis, while summing up all the values. It would be a great feature to extend this functionality so as to incorporate any other custom function, such as mean, to be used instead of sum for values of an axis in other dimensions.

- Relevant tests and documentation would be created for this functionality.

##### July 15 - July 27:

- Currently, the glue-solar loading up of IRIS data in both raster and SJI. The main aim would be to extend this functionality into the newer NDCube format, and also allow linking between both of the types of the data.

- All the relevant tests and documentation would be created.

#### July 27 - July 31: Phase 2 Evaluations

#### July 31 - August 31: Phase 3 Coding

- In this phase, we would create the first official release, so that the package would be available for installation through PyPi.

- Any leftover work (in terms of documentation and/or coding) would be completed.

- Bugs (if any) would be solved.

#### August 24 -August 31: Phase 3 Evaluations


## Miscellaneous

#### Q. Have you participated previously in GSoC? When? With which project?

I have not participated in GSoC before. This is the first time that I would be participating in GSoC.

#### Q. Are you also applying to other projects?

No. This is the only project and SunPy under OpenAstronomy is the only organization that I have applied for.


### Commitment

* Currently I'm doing an internship as well, which is now remote because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The internship commenced in January 2020 and will end in June 2020. Therefore, I will be able to only give at most 5 hours during the weekdays. But I will cover up for that during the weekends, by working around 9 hours on those days. In this way, I would be able to spare 35-40 hours for the project per week.

* I might have to go to college for 2-3 days in July regarding project evaluations and other formalities; the dates are not finalized yet. But, will let the mentors know about that beforehand, and will cover up the lost hours before or after the formalities are done.
