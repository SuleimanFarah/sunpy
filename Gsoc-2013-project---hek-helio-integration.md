The Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK) is a US-based effort to collect and catalog solar and heliospheric events.  Its focus is mainly the inner heliosphere. On the other hand the [HELiophysics Integrated Observatory)[http://helio.eu] (HELIO) is a set of services which includes [Events](http://hec.helio.eu) and [Feature](http://hfc.helio.eu) catalogues (known as hec and hfc), an [Instrument Location](http://www.helio-vo.eu/services/interfaces/helio-ils_uix.php) and [Capability](http://www.helio-vo.eu/services/interfaces/helio-ics_uix.php) Service (ILS & ICS), and a [data provider access](http://www.helio-vo.eu/services/interfaces/helio-dpas_uix.php) (DPAS).  All of them can be accessed from the [main interface](http://hfe.helio.eu) and by SOAP or REST webservices. There's also a propagation model ([SHEBA](http://cagnode58.cs.tcd.ie/PropagationModelGUI/)) which helps to match events in the Sun with other locations in the heliosphere.

## Uses of HEK

## Uses of HELIO
HELIO provides a large set of services, even more than the ones set above, therefore it uses can vary on what the user wants.  For now we should focus on single uses on some of the services. Notice that the webservices produces votables (AstroPy has support to that file format).
### HELIO Catalogues
The event and the feature catalogue contains a list of catalogues similar to those in HEK, but for events in all the heliosphere.

### Instrument Location
ILS provides information about the location of planets and spacecraft.
