### Meeting Notes

**SunPy Roles**:

[List of Proposed Roles](https://demo.codimd.org/rYN6JhH2RzK50QUBzyVcSA?view#)

Discussion of difference between _Affiliated package liaison_ and _Instrument package liaison_<BR>
    Affiliated package liaison is for a specific set of SunPy-adjacent packages; instrument packages might not be, or want to be, affiliated packages, so needs are different.

How we get this rolling? We don't need a vote, just a "blessing" from the board.<BR>
Stuart wants to write a blog post, with time commitments estimates, and email the mailing list.
A PR will be created with a time limit for comments.

Monica got some suggestions from Brigitta at Astropy that she tried to incorporate in the roles list.
* Don't have too many roles – this leads to viscosity in taking action
* Number of community and technical roles should be balanced, to indicate equal importance.

Actions:
* blog post and email about available roles
* create a PR for roles
