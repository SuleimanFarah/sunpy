**WIP** **INCOMPLETE**

## GSoC steps for mentors

- Projects selected need to be added to the wiki page under GSoC YYYY Project with a indepth desciption
- Mentors need to write a desciption of the students and projects to send it to the mailing list and to the montly summary.
- Mentors need to lied down in the wiki the use cases
- Tasks to do need also to be lied down (as an isue) and linked in the wiki page
- Each blog post need to be added to the project page (with a short summary)
Also read (or at least skim!) the Google Manual for mentors. It’s actually very useful.

Finally, we have the GSoC Mentor Terms and Conditions, where we try to set out openly what both what we expect from mentors and how we spend the money Google pays InterMine. We’ve done our best to be clear and correct, but things may change. Please be aware the terms and conditions are not a contract.

InterMine Obligations
InterMine will support all mentors throughout their mentorship period, providing both guidance and technical support.

All non-Cambridge based mentors will be matched with a mentor from the InterMine core team for support and backup.

Mentor Obligations
During the application period
Mentors will communicate with applicants and help them create relevant proposals.

CC any co-mentors when responding to communication from students via email.

During student selection
Mentors will discuss with their co-mentor to identify promising students.

Be aware that there are often more good students than there are slots the organisation can support. This means we may not be able to take on your favourite student.

During the community bonding and coding phases
Mentors should:

Make sure they speak to their student at least weekly.

Inform the organisation administrators if any issues arise, or seem likely to arise, including:

Mentor is unable to continue mentoring or experiencing too high workload.

Student is under performing or non responsive.

Complete all evaluations as early as possible in agreement with their co-mentor and encourage students to complete them early as well.

Please see Google guidance on poor performing students.
Coordinate vacation and out-of-office periods to ensure at least one mentor is available to respond to their student at all times. If both mentors are likely to be unavailable at the same time, please speak to an organisation administrator to arrange backup. This is particularly important around evaluation periods!

Advice for accepted students
Advice for accepted students
First of all, welcome to InterMine! We’re excited to have you working with us this year.

We’ll try to generally adhere to the Google Manuals to avoid repetition, but here are a few InterMine-specific guidelines for Google Summer of Code.

Communication
You’ll establish a personal rhythm with your mentor, but please bear the following points in mind:

Email
All students and mentors should subscribe to our InterMine GSoC public mailing list. This is to ensure that we can effectively share announcements.

Chat
You can come hang at chat.intermine.org in the #general channel, and feel free to ask for help in #support - but remember to make tickets or send emails for any big bugs or design decisions, as chat logs are transient.

Videoconferencing
Most of our students met via videoconferencing software, e.g. Skype, once every one or two weeks. You may need to meet more (or less!) often throughout the project life cycle.

Writing code
Quality
All code must be to a high standard, documented and well-commented, and accompanied by a unit test (where applicable).

Source Control
We use GitHub for our source control, with a Git Flow-like branching model. New work is done in personal forked repo branches,  periodically merged into the upstream dev branch when it appears stable.  master contains only stable releases merged from dev.

You should follow a similar model - treat github.com/intermine/yourproject as upstream and work on a branch your own fork, i.e. github.com/yourusername/yourproject, merging (or PRing for existing projects) periodically. Remember, pushed commits (to your own repo or InterMine’s) prove you’re alive and working on the project! ;)

We’ll fork your repo so there will always be an InterMine upstream.

Licence
If you’re starting a brand new project, think about what licence you’d like.  It needs to be open source, obviously, but so long as it’s a permissive open source licence like Apache, MIT, BSD, or LGPL, we’ll probably be happy. Discuss it with your mentor before committing to a licence.

Project Management
It’s okay not to use the workplan from your proposal, but you and your mentor will need to agree to any changes.
You do need a workplan! Make sure you and your mentor have a good idea of what the deliverables are.
You’ll want to schedule regular meetings with your mentor.
Time commitment / Missed days
From the Google Manual:

GSoC needs an investment of about 30 hours a week. If you know in advance
that you’ll need to take a couple of days of vacation/break during the
Summer of Code, you should communicate that with your mentor beforehand
and plan to make up for lost days.
Outreach
We’d love to host blog posts about yourself, the work you’re planning to do, or work you have done. Equally, if you’re tweeting or blogging on a personal blog and would like us to link to it / mention you / etc., poke your mentor and we’ll give you a shout-out.

Final Report
Each student will present their project at the end of August at the InterMine Community Call - a friendly teleconference call held twice a month. The presentation will be limited to 5 minutes with a short time available for discussion after. Ideally this will be a live demonstration of your software project but can be slides or video demo instead.

Each student will also write up their project. The length and detail vary a great deal from project to project. Please coordinate with your mentor. We’ve had short blog posts that simply describe the project and provide links to the repo. Others have created detailed tutorials to use their software, and we’ve had others who wrote entire papers! This final report can be a blog post or a standalone site on github.
