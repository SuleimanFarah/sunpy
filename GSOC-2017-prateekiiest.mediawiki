== Project Proposal ==

'''Project''': ''Improvements to the Sunpy Website and Documentation with a new look and new features''.
'''Mentors''': [https://github.com/Cadair Stuart Mumford] , [https://github.com/dpshelio David Perez-Suarez]


=== Abstract ===

'''Sunpy Website'''
The [http://sunpy.org/ Sunpy Website] is the main gateway through which users get to know about the software , its versions, installation procedures, its features and many more. So for any big software, it is really essential for the users have easy access to all the resources - ''(guides and how to use the software package)''. 
It is therefore required to have a new design for it using HTML/CSS. 
It is also ensured that the theme for the website developed can be used by the current Jekyll website and also in the future by Drupal, Joomla or Medium.

'''Sunpy Documentation'''
The [http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/ Sunpy Documentation] contains all the relevant information related to the software package. 
The design for the website is now used to create a corresponding Sphinx theme. This theme will then be used for the Sunpy documentation and also for the Sunpy affiliated packages.

The website and the documentation needs much improvement in terms of design and content.

---------


=== Project Goals ===

* Design  a new look for the website using HTML/CSS which can be used by the current jekyll website and in future any other technologies like Drupal, Medium.
* Develop a sphinx theme that has the same design as the Sunpy website.
* The new sphinx theme will then be used by the Sunpy documentation and any Sunpy affiliated packages.

'''Extensions to the project I plan to work on'''

* To improve the content of the website. 
* To implement a registry of Sunpy affiliated packages on the website. 

------------
 
=== Detailed Description of the Project ===


The Sunpy Website is in its naive stage. The website is like a window to new users and developers who would like to learn about the software, its core features and also use it for their project_works. So I believe the website is a core part of the organisation which plays a vital role in conveying about the software, the organisation's work to the users outside.

It is therefore required to have a new design for the website, create a completely new look for the website with some additional features. 

It is also a necessity to have the same design for the documentation as in the website. The documentation holds all the relevant information and guides pertaining to the software and it currently uses the ''Read the docs'' theme. It would be much better if the documentation is made to have the same theme as that of the website.


'''Improvement in the current website and the documentation'''

While working on with the code and also for the installation procedures, I had to consult the documentation and in some cases the website. So I came up with some of the shortcomings which I want to improve.


{|
| ''Flaws in the Website''             ||   ''Flaws in the Documentation''
|-
|* First of all, the website needs a much improvement in the design. It needs improvement in terms of good style. ||* The Sunpy Docs has many areas lacking proper documentation like for ROI, some parts of the Lightcurve Section. Some of the functions have not been documented. So it is really important to update them.
|-
|* The website does not have a FAQ section, which is really necessary to seek answers to common questions. Hence members of the organisation need not have to answer such frequent questions. ||* The documentation should have more details for the installation procedure. It currently contains a good installation procedure, but it is also necessary to have a good installation procedure for Sphinx, Jekyll  and Graphviz.
|-
|* The gallery of the website only contains tutorial on Lightcurve using IPython Notebook. It should also contain some tutorials on map resampling, submaps and solar cycle using IPython Notebook. The website gallery have a possibility to get removed as said by my mentors.
* Also, the website doesn't contain presentations and video tutorials and research paper links. ||* The documentation currently does not contain the corresponding issues related to the details under the [http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_ref/index.html API reference]. So new developers can get more acquainted with the issues faced corresponding to the given module.
|-
|}

------


=== Milestones/Deliverable ===

* Have created a new design for the Sunpy Website.
* Have included more content in the website.
* Have developed the sphinx theme for the Sunpy Documentation having same design as that of the website.
* Have implemented a registry of Sunpy affiliated packages.

;'''Dividing the project into two parts'''


: '''First part of the project''' 

''The first part of the project deals with the design of the website and creating the sphinx theme having the same design to be used by the Sunpy documentation and the affiliated packages.''

* The tools required for the website design is chalked out in this part.

* The ''design'' of the website is sketched out  - The design will give a completely new look for the website with some additional new features.

* The design is implemented using HTML/CSS.   

: '''Second part of the project'''


* Since when I started knowing about the Sunpy codebase and started working on the issues - ''package_novice'' and ''package_medium'' ones mostly, I would always go through the documentation and try to understand exactly why the issue was brought up, before going to the coding part. So the documentation part is really crucial for beginners to understand such a huge code-work and get a better flavor about the software. Hence, I would devote my time to working on some new features to make the documentation more better. 

* I remember some of topics where I faced issues. I will thus try to clear those issues by giving more examples and also links to some extra resources which are not present in the current documentation, so that beginners don't have to face those issues again.


* I would also add some links to some of the presentations and video talks done by Sunpy on the website and also in the documentation in appropriate places.


* I also saw that there were some modules which were not defined, or the documentation for that part was not added. For example [http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/generated/api/sunpy.net.vso.attrs.Time.html  sunpy.net.vso.attrs.Time :collides, pad]. So I would like to work on them and give appropriate documentation for better understanding of the modules.


;'''Extensions to this project I would work on ''' 

: '''Improve the content of the SunPy website'''  
* The website does not contain much description on some of the core functionality of Sunpy. I plan to add some feature section where there will be bulleted list on some of the main modules of Sunpy along with their functionality (their description, what is their function in the Sunpy code base) and their corresponding links to the Sunpy Documentation.  
* I also want to create a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section in order to address some common questions from the beginners.
* I plan to upload some video lectures and presentations previously being produced from the community on the website.
* I would also want to add some more content about the instruments used here, and also some links for resources related to various issues. I would also add more about some of the core features of the latest version, so that new users can get a better understanding of the software.      
* Lastly, I want to give links to some of the latest research papers associated with the Sunpy Organisation and also some of the research papers that beginners may need in order to implement some algorithm for usage in a module.

: '''Why this extension?''' 

The Sunpy Website is in still in its initial stage and there is much to improve in the website and improving its content is one of the important things that needs to be done. Users will only get to know about the software package through the Sunpy Website and hence it is essential that get to know about it in detail, and if any confusion they may leave a question at the matrix channel. The website should include the details of some of the core libraries of Sunpy, the data sources used for the project , the description or some link to the instruments used for gathering data for Sunpy. Likewise it will be a much better outreach for Sunpy to the users interested in working on Solar Project.
 



: '''Implement a registry of SunPy Affiliated packages on the website.''' 
* Add more about some of the core features of the latest version, so that new users can get a better understanding of the software.
* Create a registry of Sunpy dependencies and the affiliated packages on the website in a prescribed format under a separate section.  
** ''A list of the affiliated packages will be kept in a publicly available location. This list shall contain links to the source code, any website associated with the package and contact details of the maintainer of the package. There will be a list of packages maintained on the www.sunpy.org website, which shall provide information to users about the affiliated packages.''

* Give description as to how to register an affiliated package 
** ''To register an affiliated package it is needed to contact the chair of the SunPy board, or another board member, who will propose the package to the board who will then make a decision on that package.''

* Packaging Affiliated Packages
** To make it easier for developers to maintain affiliated packages a package template will be provided. This will allow package maintainers to not have to worry about Python packaging and documentation / testing infrastructure, and concentrate on the development of their package. This template will provide a package which is laid out and behaves much like the core SunPy library.

: '''Why this extension?''' 

The Affiliated Packages are registered with the SunPy Project to benefit from the publicity and support available within the SunPy community, while maintaining their independence and control over the package. As a community-driven project SunPy encourages contributions from a diverse group of people on a wide range of software. Not all solar physics software falls within the remit of the core SunPy library, and some software developers may wish to maintain a degree of control over their software than it being part of the core library would afford them. Both of these reasons provide motivation for software which is associated with SunPy but not contained within the core library. Having an association with SunPy will provide advantages to these packages, such as the knowledge of the SunPy community and the publicity provided by SunPy, while also allowing the whole SunPy ecosystem to grow and provide useful tools to a larger audience.


 

Lastly,
* The sphinx theme is developed having the same design as that of the website.
* This theme is now used for the Sunpy Documentation and for other affiliated packages for Sunpy.

=== Benefits to the Community ===
I have always a fascination for Astronomy and I am excited to be able to do my utmost to contribute to such a project. 
The website of SunPy is still in development state. I believe that by the time I complete this project I would be able to give a new look to the website along with improved content and features which will be beneficial for all users who want to use Sunpy for knowing about the software and also using it for their project work.

=== Software Packages to be used ===   

* '''Sphinx''' : Sphinx is a tool that allows us to create as many restructured documents as we want and then it merges them together into a single website or a book. It uses HTML, LaTeX as its output format. 

* '''Jekyll''' : Jekyll is a tool to transform any plain text into static websites and blogs. The current Sunpy website uses Jekyll.

== How I wish to complete the project ==

I am confident of completing this project because this project interests me a lot and also fits my current skill sets. 
I will work on the project regularly and give regular updates to my mentors about my progress and seek guidance if I face any problem. I would try to adhere to the timetable proposed for weekly progress and try my best to complete the project before time.
I will also push code regularly so that the mentors can keep track of my progress. Also I’ll try to make the commit messages and documentation clear and concise to help anyone who works with the code in the future.
At the end of the project, I would still like to be inside the Sunpy channel as a contributor to make new improvements to the software and also clear any doubts regarding future use of my code work.


== GSoC ==

=== Have you participated previously in GSoC? When? With which project? ===

I have not participated in GSoC before. This is the first time that I would be participating in GSoC.

Are you also applying to other projects?

No. This is the only project and SunPy under OpenAstronomy is the only organization that I have applied for.

-----------

=== Commitment ===

* I don’t have any other internships or work for the summer. I don’t have any plans to go on vacation either.

* My classes for the new semester will begin around October 5th, but I would still be able to give sufficient time for the project as academic load is very less during the initial few weeks of the semester. I will be able to spare 35-40 hours for the project per week easily.

* Also, because my summer vacation starts on May 7, I will start working on the project early so that I can try to complete the project well before the deadline ( around 2-3 weeks before the deadline ). 

* I have my semester exams from 22nd of April to 1 May. So I will not be able to contribute much time to the project work during this time. Still I will try to devote 2-3 hours everyday to do my work.

* SunPy is the only organization and this project is the only project that I have applied for.
