From the #gsoc meeting on 2013/04/19:

<carols> sunpy folks 
<sunpy|renstar> indeed 
<sunpy|renstar> hello 
<sunpy|keith> hi 
<carols> i just want to start off by saying i like the sun. 
<carols> anyway 
<carols> you're ideas page looked great. 
<carols> loved the structure and the ideas. 
<sunpy|renstar> great, thanks! 
<sunpy|cadair> Thanks, I was worried there wasn't enough. 
<carols> no, that was about right. 
<carols> any shorter and it probably would have been a problem 
<carols> but anyway, you seem to be a large org, maybe you could have had even more? 
<sunpy|renstar> actually we are quite small 
<carols> ah, ok 
<carols> i was just going based on something from your app i saw 
<carols> "The SunPy project is large enough that it will not be difficult to find another mentor that is familiar with the project." 
<sunpy|renstar> ahhh, yeah, i see 
<sunpy|renstar> perhaps 'tight' is better than 'large' 
<carols> anyway, regardless. it would have helped you a bit to have another org vouch for you 
<sunpy|keith> hmm. perhaps "friends of SunPy" would have been a better phrase 
<carols> not the end of the world, just something to consider 
<sunpy|renstar> yeah, this is our first time with gsoc 
<sunpy|renstar> we've had other soc students from other programs last summer 
<sunpy|renstar> but we can definitely look for an org to vouch next year 
<carols> it looks like we just had a lot of space this year as well :-) 
<carols> i'm feeling like a broken record here. 
<sunpy|keith> heh 
<sunpy|cadair> There is an awful lot of space. 
<carols> i actually don't see any other problems with the app or the ideas page. 
<carols> indeed there is :-) 
<sunpy|keith> that's good to know 
<carols> i would encourage you to apply again next year for sure. 
<sunpy|cadair> very encouraging. 
<sunpy|keith> anything that might help set us apart in the future? 
<carols> a couple more ideas might help? 
<carols> a vouch from another organization? 
<carols> maybe try to find an org to umbrella you this year and then use them to vouch for you next year? 
<sunpy|cadair> We are under the PSF now :) 
<sunpy|keith> yea, we applied with the PSF this year 
<carols> ah, cool :-) 
<carols> so then work with them this summer and see if you can reapply with a vouch from them next year. 
<carols> everything else looks good to me 
<sunpy|keith> sounds good. thanks for taking the time to give us feedback, carols! 
<sunpy|keith> keep up the good work with GSoC 
<carols> of course! 
<carols> happy friday, and thanks for waiting 
<sunpy|renstar> ok, so vouch plus hope to come up on the right side ofthe numbers game 
<sunpy|renstar> thanks again! 
<carols> yep, indeed 
<carols> cheers 
<carols> moving along! 
<sunpy|cadair> yes, thanks a lot, I have driven how 50% of the Uk while this has been going on:) 
<sunpy|keith> cheers
