This page holds information and stuff relating to the Documenation Sprint on the 29th November 2013.

The workflow for the sprint is: 

* there is a feature branch on the main SunPy repo where all doc work and PRs should be aimed during the day. 
* We will have a PR session every 3 hours were people should send PRs and we can review and merge them. The idea of this is to keep a running copy of what the docs look like. 
* Obviously PRs are welcome at other times throughout the day.

Tips:
* PR often and commit even more
* Claim an issue / task before you start working on it
* Join IRC(#SunPy on irc.freenode.net) and the google plus [hangout](https://plus.google.com/events/cil7ndamh5edn8ucis02cffslg0)

The user guide section and the gallery are the main targets, the user guide target structure will be merged into the feature branch as first task in the morning.
