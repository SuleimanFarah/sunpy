Features changed or updated:

1. Removal of Optional PIL dependancy 
2. Parse_time now looks through nested lists/tuples 
3. Draw_limb and draw_grid are now implemented on mapcube 
4. mapcube.plot() now runs a mpl animation with optional controls 
5. A basic Region of Interest framework now exists under sunpy.roi 
6. STEREO COR colour maps have been ported from solarsoft. 
7. sunpy.time.timerange has a split() method that divides up a time range into n equal parts. 

Bug fixes or under the hood chnages: 

1. A major re-work of all interal imports has resulted in a much cleaner namespace, i.e. sunpy.util.util is no longer used to import util. 
2. Some SOHO and STEREO files were not importing properly due to a date_obs parameter. 
3. Sunpy will now read JP2 files without a comment parameter.
