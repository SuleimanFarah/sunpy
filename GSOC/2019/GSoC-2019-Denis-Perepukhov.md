# Project: Develop sunkit image

Organisation: sunpy

# 1. Information about me

## 1.1. Personal data

* Name - Denis Perepukhov
* Age - 19
* City - Moscow, Russia (GMT+3)
* Contact info:
github - [kaif2100](https://github.com/kaif2100);
riot - kaif2100;
* Sample code - [server & client](https://github.com/kaif2100/health/tree/server) (see 1.4)

## 1.2. Education

Now I'm a sophomore at [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/) at at the faculty of aerophysics and space research.

## 1.3. Skills

I have skills in math, physics, analytical mechanics, in programming: C, C++ (a little boost and parallel programming), python (I passed [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/diving-in-python): [diploma](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/5SSSEMA5YFT6)) and SQL a little.

## 1.4. Projects

I have participated [Hack.Moscow v2.0](https://medium.com/@russianhackers/hack-moscow-v2-0-fca9674c8d98) with my friends, we tried to [make a site](https://devpost.com/software/modern-healthcare?ref_content=existing_user_added_to_software_team&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=email&utm_campaign=software&utm_content=added_to_software_team&utm_medium=email&utm_source=transactional), I was in charge of [server part](https://github.com/kaif2100/health/tree/server), client and database (we failed to connect the server to the site).
Unfortunately, that's all except my personal projects on python(image processing, local servers) and on C++.

## 1.5 Interest in Open Astronomy

### Motivation

Since childhood, I was interested in science and wanted to move it forward. In school I realized that I was interested in space. Such a vast, beautiful and brutal. Since then, I have dreamed a lot about space, read a lot of science fiction books (my favorite is “Inhabited island” by Strugatsky brothers).

I understand that life, unfortunately, is not a book - it is much more severe. But I decided that I wanted to contribute to space exploration, because this is one of the most important steps in the development of mankind and one day I want to wake up and realize that man now lives not only on Earth and conquers the cosmic expanses, which beckon with their unknown. For this reason, I entered the faculty of aerophysics and space research, hoping to link my future life with space. Now I'm only a sophomore, but I know quite a lot in mathematics, physics and programming and I really want to apply this knowledge to the benefit of society. So I decided to try to participate in GSoC and specifically watched projects related to space. The presented projects (at the ideas list), in my opinion, will be useful for people working in the space sphere, and for me it will be a good start in this area.

### Why do I want to work with sunpy?

I'm very interested in astronomy and programming, so I want to work with you because I will learn a lot of new things, finally learn how to apply my skills and I will be useful to the community through the implementation of the project.

# 2. Application for “Develop sunkit image”

## 2.1 Summary

This project is attractive to me because I'm very interested in astronomy and I really want to learn new things about sun and how it works and want to get skills in image processing (it will be useful for me in the future). And this project will be useful for community and I want to make useful project.
I think I can manage with this project because I have skills in math (what is required according to the ideas list),
python (I write neat and clear code, it's important for an open source project), a little in image processing (a short course at the university) and I can study fast, so I will learn new topics in 1 - 2 weeks.

# 3. Project plan

## 3.1. Main points

### Before GSoC

communicate with mentors and community, find information related to the project, realise the structure of the project. I'll be honest: I won't have much time before the GSoC because of sessie.

### During GSoC

Explore new areas related to the project, create a model;
Code (code sleep repeat);
Test and debug;

### After GSoC

I plan to continue contributing to the space open source projects and develop skills in space area.
I have an idea to think about and maybe implement (It's about guide for people who want to start career in space area, but they don't know how to do it).

## 3.2. Timeline

At the moment, I can not provide a clear schedule. I agree with the plan provided in the list of ideas:

### May 27 - June 28

I'll take 1 - 2 weeks to learn the necessary things and get acquainted with the project and algorithms.
After this step I'll do a scheme of a project, exact schedule and start coding (test and debug while coding).
Milestones:
Have implemented, tested and documented the NRGF code.
Have implemented, tested and documented the MGN code.

### June 28 - July 22

I'll be focused on coding and I'll keep in touch with mentors and community to find mistakes during coding, not at the end.
Milestones:
Have successfully merged the NRGF and MGN code.
Have implemented OCCULT-2.

### July 26 - August 19

I plan to end the main part of code and focus on tests and debugging.
Have implemented, tested and documented soft morphological filtering code.
Have tested, documented and merged the OCCULT-2 code.

## 3.3. Schedule availability

During the summer I have a lot free time and good internet connection, so I'll work on the project and go for a walk every evening to clean up my mind :)

# 4. Conclusion

First of all - thank you for spending time to reading my proposal (I tried to do it well, but it's awful anyway). I'm very motivated to get involved into this project. I know I have very little chances, but I will study this project and the entire space sphere to contribute and try to be selected in GSoC again.

Sincerely,
Denis Perepukhov
