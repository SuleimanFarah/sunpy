## Release 0.5
Summary of this release: This release will continue integration with Astropy. 
* 70%+ Test coverage
* Functions should accept astropy quantities
* Integrate Astropy time object into parse_time() and the Time Range object
* LightCurve Refactor

## Release 0.6
* 80%+ Test coverage
* Include high quality solar ephemeris library
* Integrate astropy coordinates
* Re-factor of WCS into an object-oriented approach. For example, define an observer object which gives distance from Sun, heliographic longitude and latitude, etc.
* Refactor plotting functions outside of core datatypes

## Release 0.7


## Release 0.8

## Release 0.9

## Release 1.0
* Have a generalised coordinate system representation shared by *all* data types, i.e. Astropy Generalised WCS or HyperMap coordinate system.
* Complete integration of all core data types, i.e. slice a Map to get a Lightcurve
* Complete integration with Astropy, i.e. All code supports units, and a generalised coordinate system.
