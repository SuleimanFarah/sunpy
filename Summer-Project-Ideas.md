This page is a ideas board for summer of code projects, these ideas should be expanded into full blown proposals / SEPs for ideas pages for GSOC / SOCIS etc.

## Feature Tracking / Detection

Framework and algorithms for detecting features in the solar atmosphere / magnetic fields on the solar surface.

Detection algorithms:

* Thresholding
* Clumping
* Downhill
* Curve

Tracking and property extraction using labelling and similar. 

## HEK searching and overlays in Ginga

Query the HEK both manually and automatically from ginga and overlay the results on the images

## Downloader integration with Database and Ginga

Replace the VSO integration in the database module with the Unified Downloader and then integrate full querying in a Ginga plugin.

## Refactor and Factory Spectrogram

Build a Spectra() factory and refactor the whole `sunpy.spectra` module to pull it inline with Map and LightCurve.
