### Education:

I completed my primary and secondary education from Delhi Public School, Maruti Kunj [April 1997 - March 2010]. Some of the teachers in School were really amazing. They would show videos, organize discussion sessions, lab demonstrations and what not! They made studying real fun. From their I went to Delhi Public School R.K Puram for my Senior High School.

Currently, I am a third year undergraduate studying Materials Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I will graduate from here in April, 2016.

###4. Work and Open Source Experience:

Although I haven't really had much experience contributing to Open source Projects, I have extensive experience in developing projects implementing scientific and mathematical ideas. I built a set of scripts using panda, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, QSTK to perform algorithmic trading. I also  implemented a grain strain measurement software based on Electron BackScattering Diffraction (EBSD) maps last semester using Python, numpy, scipy and matplotlibs for my Mechanical Properties Lab. In Current semester as well I am heading the development of SaaS project, a cloud based extractive metallurgy simulation by using Python for module development, Bootstrap for frontend and Python web micro-framework flask for backend. You may find my software source code here: https://github.com/ankitkmr

    * **Operating System Experience:** Currently, I use Mac OSx. Also I have used Ubuntu and Windows for a few years back.

###5. Proposal Title: Sunpy-Support for analysis of Solar Energetic Particles

###6. Proposal Abstract:
     A short description of your proposed project

###7. Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline:

Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. You may wish to read the GSoC student guide which includes several examples of good proposals with timelines, or our own information at SummerOfCode/Application
Note that any pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during the community bonding period (April 27-May 24). Students will be expected to start producing code starting on May 25th.

###8. Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org:

###Schedule:

I do not have any other internship or involvements(and I am not planning to have any) for the Summer 2015. I may go on vacation (for 3-4 days) but that will be either before the coding period begins or after the coding period ends.
I have classes during last two weeks of coding period but since the academic load is very less in the beginning of semester, I will be able to spare at least 30-35 hours for the project per week. Also, to be on a safer side, I will begin early (Since our institute summer vacation starts from 1 May) and try to complete the project around 2-3 weeks before the deadline.

Also I haven't applied to any other organization except SunPy.

###Eligibility:
Yes, I am eligible to receive payments from Google.
For any queries, clarifications or further explanation of any approach/feature feel free to contact me and I shall be happy to reply.
