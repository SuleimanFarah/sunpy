# Email Address for JSOC

The SunPy test suite (and some affiliated packages) need a registered email address to use the JSOC export service.

After some discussions with JSOC this email has to go to an email address which is checked by a human.
However, it gets significant traffic from the CI generating export notifications.

The email address to use is `jsoc@sunpy.org` this is configured as a forwarder to people who are up for monitoring it with some email filtering!
