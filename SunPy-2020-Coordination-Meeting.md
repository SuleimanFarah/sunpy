This will be the first of a yearly series of in-person SunPy Coordination meetings. The purpose of this meeting is to 
* plan for the next sunpy core release cycle
* coordinate development across all of the core subpackages
* coordinate development between SunPy and affiliated packages
* discuss long-term roadmap
* enable in-person development

The meeting will be open for anyone to attend but key team members (e.g. maintainers, affiliated package leads, key devs, SunPy board members) will be invited. This meeting will also be used as an opportunity to recognize outstanding contributions to the community.

**Meeting time frame**: March 30 to April 3.

Discussion topics are to be decided by the community but the meeting should begin with a state of union talk by the lead developer followed by lightning talks by each of the sub-package maintainers as well as affiliated package leads.
