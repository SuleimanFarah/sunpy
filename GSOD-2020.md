# Ideas

## Documentation Refactor - adding the why 
**Mentors:** [samaloney](http://github.com/samaloney), [Cadair](https://github.com/Cadair)

**Description:** SunPy has extensive documentation for both [users](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/index.html) and [developers](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/index.html). However a lot of this documentation is focused on the technical aspects of how to do something but doesn't explain why or what. It is also not immediately obvious where to get what type of information. This [blog post](https://documentation.divio.com) and accompanying video from PyCon Australia 2017 do a fanatic job of outlining the different functions and aims of the four major categories of documentation: information and tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation.

For a great example of this approach see django [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)

Sunpy already has documentations that covers 3 of these categories pretty well if not in the exact same format:

| Section | Current Docs |
|--|---|
|Information and Tutorials | [User Guide](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/guide/index.html) and [Example gallery](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/generated/gallery/index.html) |
|How-Tos | [User Guide](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/guide/index.html) and [Example gallery](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/generated/gallery/index.html) |
|Explanations | Some information scattered through out documentation |
| Reference | [Code Ref](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/code_ref/index.html) |


The idea for this years GSOD would be refactor the documentation to make content more discoverable and in particular to create an easy to discover place for "Explanations". This would involve working with the community to reorganise and edit the existing documentation and facilitating the creation of new content by providing authoring guidelines for each type of documentation. The aim would be for the community and technical writer to collaborate to create new content especially around domain specific topics. The guidelines would allow the maintenance and expansion of the documentation beyond this years GSOD and into the future.
