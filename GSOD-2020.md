# Ideas

## Documentation Refactor - adding the why 
**Mentors:** [samaloney](http://github.com/samaloney), 

**Description:** SunPy has extensive documentation for both [users](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/index.html) and [developers](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/dev_guide/index.html). However a lot of this documentation is focused on the technical aspects of how to do something but doesn't explain why or what. It is also not immediately obvious where to get what type of information. This [blog post](https://documentation.divio.com) and accompanying video from PyCon Australia 2017 do a fanatic job of outlining the different functions and aims of the four major categories of documentation: information and tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation.

For a great example of this approach see django [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)

Sunpy already has extensive documentations that covers 3 of these categories pretty well if not in the exact same format:

| Section | Current Docs |
|--|---|
|Information and Tutorials | [User Guide](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/guide/index.html) and [Example gallery](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/generated/gallery/index.html) |
|How-Tos | [User Guide](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/guide/index.html) and [Example gallery](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/generated/gallery/index.html) |
|Explanations | Some information scattered through out documentation |
| Reference | [Code Ref](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/code_ref/index.html) |


The idea for this years GSOD would be refactor the documentation to follow this layout and in particular to create and populate the Explanations section. Pulling some existing content from other areas of the documentation and create new content around common hot topics such as Maps, coordinates and visualisation for example.
