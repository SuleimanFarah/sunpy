# Abstract
The SunPy organization currently lacks a formal organization structure. This proposal defines the SunPy organization.

# Detailed Description

The organization of SunPy is modeled on that usually adopted by non-profit organizations (e.g. [501c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization). This organization structure is tried and tested and has the added advantage that it should provide a smooth transition to incorporating a SunPy foundation if it becomes necessary in the future (e.g. for funding purposes). The primary role of the organization is to 
* expand and maintain the sunpy software library
* manage and protect the SunPy brand and identity
* promote SunPy to the community
The organization consists of an executive director, a board, and the developer community. This goal of the proposed structure to provide and promote community input into the project.

* Executive director
* The Board
The organization structure of SunPy consists of a core team whose role is to provide a consistent and stable leadership to the project. The term _SunPy Team_ refers to the core, maintainers, and developers.

## The Board
The primary function of the board is to elect an executive director as well as review and vote on proposed SPEs. SPEs are the primary mechanism through which all major changes are proposed and accepted. The board shall consist of ten members which represent both founders, developers, and users. The executive director may be a member of the board and have voting rights but it is not required. The board shall elect a chair as well as a secretary. The responsibilities of the chair is to organize and lead meetings of the board. The board secretary shall take notes for all meetings of the board. Board members shall serve one renewable one year terms. Election to the board requires agreement of the majority of the entire board. Board meetings require a quorum where a quorum is defined as half of the board. The board shall hold regular meetings with the executive directory.

## The Advisory Board


The role of the core is to lead the development of the SunPy project. The core consists of (only) 3 members from the SunPy community. All major decisions must be accepted unanimously(?) by the core team. The core members have owner privileges to the SunPy organization on github. Maintainers have pull privileges to the sunpy repo

## The maintainers
The role of the maintainers is to handle the day to day running of SunPy which includes reviewing code contributions, assigning issues to developers. 

## The developers
Developers are responsible for developing and maintaining the code base.  Contributors can become developers by providing at least one pull request which is accepted and self nominating themselves using the standard SunPy communication channels. Since this requires a change to SunPy team a core member must implement this change.

## The Community Manager
The role of the community manager is to 

## The Board
The board consists of members outside of the SunPy community whose purpose is to provide advice and guidance to the SunPy Team.
