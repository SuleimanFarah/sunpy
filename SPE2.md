# Abstract
The SunPy organization currently lacks a formal organization structure. This proposal defines the SunPy organization.

# Detailed Description

The organization of SunPy is modeled on that usually adopted by non-profit organizations (e.g. [501c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization). This organization structure is tried and tested and has the added advantage that it should provide a smooth transition to incorporating a SunPy foundation if it becomes necessary in the future (e.g. for funding purposes). The primary role of the organization is to 
* expand and maintain the sunpy software library
* manage and protect the SunPy brand and identity
* promote SunPy to the community
The organization consists of an executive director, a board, and the developer community. This goal of the proposed structure to provide and promote community input into the project.

## Board of Directors
The primary function of the board is to elect an executive director as well as review and vote on proposed SPEs. SPEs are the primary mechanism through which all major changes to SunPy both the organization and the codebase are proposed and accepted. 

* **Membership Limit**: The board shall consist of at least 5 members and no more than 10 members. Within these limits, the board may increase or decrease the number of directors serving on the board, including for the purpose of staggering the terms of members.

* **Term Length**: All members shall be elected to serve a one-year term, however the term may be extended until a successor has been elected.

* **Staggering**: Members terms shall be staggered so that approximately half the number of members will end their terms in any given year.

* Members may serve terms in succession.

* The term of office shall be considered to begin January 1 and end December 31 of the second year in office, unless the term is extended until such time as a successor has been elected.

* **Vacancies**: The board may fill vacancies or may appoint new members to fill a previously unfilled board position, subject to the maximum number of directors under these Bylaws.

* **Removal**: A member may be removed by two-thirds vote of the board of then in office, if (a) the member is absent and unexcused from X or more meetings of the board in a twelve month period.  The board chair is empowered to excuse members from attendance for a reason deemed adequate by the board chair. The chair shall not have the power to excuse him/herself from the board meeting attendance and in that case, the board vice chair shall excuse the president. Or (b) for cause or no cause, if before any meeting of the board at which a vote on removal will be made the director in question is given electronic or written notification of the boardâ€™s intention to discuss her/his case and is given the opportunity to be heard at a meeting of the board.

* **Quorum**:  A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum for a meeting of the board. No business shall be considered by the board at any meeting at which a quorum is not present.

* **Majority Vote**:  Except as otherwise specified the act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board.

* **Hung Board Decisions**: On the occasion of a tie, the board chair or vice-chair in the order of presence shall have the power to swing the vote based on his/her discretion.

* **Regular Meetings**:  The board of shall have a minimum of X regular meetings each calendar year at times and places fixed by the board. Board meetings shall provide at least four (4) days notice. Notice of meetings shall specify the place, day, and hour of meeting. The purpose of the meeting need not be specified. The executive director shall report to the board during these meetings.

* **Special Meetings**:  Special meetings of the board may be called by the chair or vice-chair or any two (2) members directors of the board.  A special meeting must be preceded by at least 2 days notice to each member of the date, time, and place, but not the purpose, of the meeting.

* **Board officers**: The officers of the board shall be a board chair, vice-chair, and secretary, all of whom shall be chosen by, and serve at the pleasure of, the board.  

* **Board Chair**: The board chair shall lead the board in performing its duties and responsibilities, including, if present, leading all meetings of the board, and shall perform all other duties incident to the office or properly required by the board. The boar chair shall serve as the primary point of contact for SPEs. The chair shall have ownership privileges to the sunpy github organization and can delegate this authority to any other chair member.

* **Vice-chair**: In the absence of the board chair, the vice-chair shall perform the duties of the board chair. When so acting, the vice-chair shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the board chair.

* **Secretary**: The secretary shall keep or cause to be kept a book of minutes of all meetings and actions of board.  The minutes of each meeting shall state the time and place that it was held, the members present, and such other information as shall be necessary to determine the actions taken and whether the meeting was held in accordance with the law and these Bylaws.  

* **Executive Directory**: The board shall select an executive director (ED). The ED cannot also serve as the board chair. The ED may also be a member of the board though this is not required. 

## The Executive Director
The role of the executive director is to manage the day to day operations of the SunPy organization. The executive director (ED for short) shall report to the board. The executive director shall have push privileges to the sunpy repo and can elect SunPy maintainers from the developer community to have the same privileges. The ED shall have ownership privileges to the sunpy github organization. The executive directory shall hold regular meetings with the developer community.

## The Development Committee


## The Advisory Board
The board or executive director may appoint an advisory board to advise the board and executive director.

## The maintainers
The role of the maintainers is to handle the day to day running of SunPy which includes reviewing code contributions, assigning issues to developers. Maintainers are elected by the executive director.

## The developers
Developers are responsible for developing and maintaining the sunpy code base.  Developers come from the contributor community and can become developers by providing at least one pull request which is accepted and self nominating themselves using the standard SunPy communication channels. The executive director (or a member of the board in consultation with the ED) can add the contributor to the developer team.
