# Abstract
The SunPy organization currently lacks a formal organization structure. This proposal defines the SunPy organization.

# Detailed Description

The organization of SunPy is modeled on that usually adopted by non-profit organizations (e.g. [501c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization). This organization structure is tried and tested and has the added advantage that it should provide a smooth transition to incorporating a SunPy foundation if it becomes necessary in the future (e.g. for funding purposes). The primary role of the organization is to 
* expand and maintain the sunpy software library
* manage and protect the SunPy brand and identity
* promote SunPy to the community
The organization consists of an executive director, a board, and the developer community. This goal of the proposed structure to provide and promote community input into the project.

## The Board
The primary function of the board is to elect an executive director as well as review and vote on proposed SPEs. SPEs are the primary mechanism through which all major changes are proposed and accepted. The board shall consist of at least ten members which represent both founders, developers, and users. The executive director may be a member of the board and have voting rights though this is not required. The board shall elect a chair as well as a secretary. The chair cannot also be the executive director. The responsibilities of the chair is to organize and lead meetings of the board as well as serve as the primary point of contact for SPEs. The chair shall appoint SPE editors. The secretary shall take notes for all meetings of the board. Board members shall serve renewable one year terms. Election to the board requires agreement of the majority of the entire board. Board meetings require a quorum where a quorum is defined as half of the board. The board shall hold regular meetings with the executive directory. The board can also increase its maximum membership through a majority vote by the entire board. The chair shall have ownership privileges to the sunpy github organization and can delegate this authority to any other chair member.

## The Executive Director
The role of the executive director is to manage the day to day operations of the SunPy organization. The executive director (ED for short) shall report to the board and can be a member of the board. The executive director shall have push privileges to the sunpy repo and can elect SunPy maintainers from the developer community to have the same privileges. The executive director shall appoint at least one community director. The ED shall have ownership privileges to the sunpy github organization. The executive directory shall hold regular meetings with the developer community.

## The Advisory Board
The SunPy organization may appoint an advisory board to advise the board and executive director.

## The maintainers
The role of the maintainers is to handle the day to day running of SunPy which includes reviewing code contributions, assigning issues to developers. Maintainers are elected by the executive director.

## The developers
Developers are responsible for developing and maintaining the sunpy code base.  Developers come from the contributor community and can become developers by providing at least one pull request which is accepted and self nominating themselves using the standard SunPy communication channels. The executive director (or a member of the board in consultation with the ED) can add the contributor to the developer team.

## The Community Manager
The role of the community manager (CM) is to promote the project to the community. The community manager may be a member of the board though it is not required. The CM is chosen by the executive director.
